But other  ways,  like talking  to someone  you trust,  can lead you to solving  your problem  or at least feeling  better.  Try taking  these  four steps.  the next time you are stressed:  (1) Get support.  When  you need  help,  reach  out to the people  who care about  you. Talk to a trusted  adult,  such as a parent  or other  relatives.    72    They  might  have  had similar  problems,  such as dealing  with a test, or the death  of a beloved  pet. (2) Don’t take it out on yourself.  Sometimes  when  kids are stressed  and upset  they take it out on themselves.  Oh, dear,  that’s not a good  idea.  Remember  that there    are always  people  to help you. Don’t take it out on yourself.    73    (3) Try to solve  the problem.  After  you’re calm  and you have  support  from  adults  and friends,  it’s time to get down  to business.    74    Even  if you can’t solve  it all, you can solve  a piece  of it. (4) Be positive.  Most  stress  is temporary  (暂时的 ). Remember  stress  does go away,  especially  when  you figure  out the problem  and start working  on solving  it.  These  steps  aren’t magic,  but they do work.  And if you can stay positive  as you you’re  your way through  a tough  time,  you’ll help yourself  feel better  even  faster.    75    A. Ask for a helping  hand  to get you through  the tough  situation.  B. Notice  your friends ’ feelings  and find a way to help them.  C. Different  people  feel stress  in different  ways.  D. Ah, it feels  so good  when  the stress  is gone.  E. You need  to figure  out what  the problem  is. F. And don’t forget  about  your friends.  G. Then,  find a way to calm  down.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, best_of=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=-1, min_p=0.0, seed=None, use_beam_search=False, length_penalty=1.0, early_stopping=False, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=512, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None), prompt_token_ids: [151644, 8948, 198, 2610, 525, 264, 10950, 17847, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 872, 198, 56568, 101909, 22574, 101057, 3837, 100638, 31838, 89012, 106367, 14582, 25, 51461, 117, 16038, 99534, 16744, 43815, 41175, 45181, 99534, 16744, 104813, 109487, 15946, 115751, 26232, 68756, 17254, 107762, 44290, 108721, 109487, 59133, 109487, 105656, 112794, 17714, 115916, 109487, 1773, 220, 22522, 17744, 2820, 25, 220, 13322, 220, 7354, 220, 369, 10805, 220, 8464, 220, 50798, 220, 5221, 31547, 220, 882, 311, 882, 13, 262, 220, 22, 16, 262, 4329, 220, 5510, 220, 315, 14550, 220, 448, 8464, 220, 12448, 1075, 34001, 220, 476, 19558, 220, 4325, 220, 12448, 1513, 1405, 11625, 220, 320, 100638, 873, 1753, 13, 220, 1988, 1008, 220, 5510, 11, 220, 1075, 7404, 220, 311, 4325, 220, 498, 6950, 11, 220, 646, 2990, 498, 311, 21828, 220, 697, 3491, 220, 476, 518, 3245, 8266, 220, 2664, 13, 220, 9735, 4633, 220, 1493, 220, 3040, 7354, 13, 220, 279, 1790, 882, 498, 525, 31547, 25, 220, 320, 16, 8, 2126, 1824, 13, 220, 3197, 220, 498, 1184, 220, 1492, 11, 220, 5545, 220, 700, 311, 279, 1251, 220, 879, 2453, 911, 220, 498, 13, 18976, 311, 264, 21789, 220, 6683, 11, 220, 1741, 438, 264, 2681, 220, 476, 1008, 220, 28558, 13, 262, 220, 22, 17, 262, 2379, 220, 2578, 220, 614, 220, 1030, 4428, 220, 5322, 11, 220, 1741, 438, 14550, 220, 448, 264, 1273, 11, 476, 279, 4545, 220, 315, 264, 27430, 220, 6753, 13, 320, 17, 8, 4320, 1405, 1896, 432, 700, 389, 6133, 13, 220, 17688, 220, 979, 220, 6837, 525, 31547, 220, 323, 22459, 220, 807, 1896, 432, 700, 389, 5577, 13, 220, 8670, 11, 24253, 11, 220, 429, 748, 537, 264, 1661, 220, 4522, 13, 220, 19881, 220, 429, 1052, 262, 525, 2677, 220, 1251, 220, 311, 1492, 498, 13, 4320, 1405, 1896, 432, 700, 389, 6133, 13, 262, 220, 22, 18, 262, 320, 18, 8, 9735, 311, 11625, 220, 279, 3491, 13, 220, 4636, 220, 498, 3129, 19300, 220, 323, 498, 614, 220, 1824, 220, 504, 220, 12598, 220, 323, 4780, 11, 220, 432, 748, 882, 311, 633, 1495, 220, 311, 2562, 13, 262, 220, 22, 19, 262, 7418, 220, 421, 498, 646, 1405, 11625, 220, 432, 678, 11, 498, 646, 11625, 220, 264, 6573, 220, 315, 432, 13, 320, 19, 8, 2823, 6785, 13, 220, 7496, 220, 8464, 220, 374, 13340, 220, 320, 105253, 9370, 7457, 19881, 220, 8464, 220, 1558, 728, 3123, 11, 220, 5310, 220, 979, 220, 498, 7071, 220, 700, 279, 3491, 220, 323, 1191, 3238, 220, 389, 21828, 220, 432, 13, 220, 4220, 220, 7354, 220, 7629, 1405, 10963, 11, 220, 714, 807, 653, 975, 13, 220, 1597, 421, 498, 646, 4717, 6785, 220, 438, 498, 498, 3129, 220, 697, 1616, 1526, 220, 264, 11045, 220, 882, 11, 220, 498, 4700, 1492, 6133, 220, 2666, 2664, 220, 1496, 220, 10596, 13, 262, 220, 22, 20, 262, 362, 13, 20437, 369, 264, 10476, 220, 1424, 220, 311, 633, 498, 1526, 220, 279, 11045, 220, 6534, 13, 220, 425, 13, 24742, 220, 697, 4780, 17744, 15650, 220, 323, 1477, 264, 1616, 311, 1492, 1105, 13, 220, 356, 13, 33396, 220, 1251, 220, 2666, 8464, 220, 304, 2155, 220, 5510, 13, 220, 422, 13, 16366, 11, 432, 11074, 220, 773, 1661, 220, 979, 220, 279, 8464, 220, 374, 8048, 13, 220, 468, 13, 1446, 1184, 220, 311, 7071, 220, 700, 1128, 220, 279, 3491, 220, 374, 13, 434, 13, 1597, 1513, 1405, 10667, 220, 911, 220, 697, 4780, 13, 220, 479, 13, 5005, 11, 220, 1477, 264, 1616, 311, 19300, 220, 1495, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198], lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

So today  I want  to give you some  wisdom  about  how to make  the most  of the time you spend  in the kitchen . Here  are three  tips for great  cooking  on a tight schedule : ①Think  ahead . The moments  when  I think  cooking  is a pain are when  I’m already  hungry  and there  is nothing  ready  to eat. So think  about  of the coming  week . When  will you have  time to cook ? Do you have  the right  materials  ready ? \u3000 37  \u3000 ②Make  your time worth  it. When  you do find time to cook  a meal , make  the most  of it and save yourself  time later on. Are you making  one loaf of bread ? \u3000 38  \u3000 it takes  around  the same  amount  of time to make  more  of something . So save yourself  the effort  for a future  meal . ③\u3000 39  \u3000 This may surprise  you, but one of the best tools  for making  cooking  worth  your time is experimentation . It gives  you the chance  to hit upon  new ideas  and recipes  that can work  well with your appetite  and schedule . The more  you learn  and the more  you try, the more  ability  you have  to take control  of your food and your schedule . Hopefully  that gives  you a good  start. \u3000 40  \u3000 and don’t let a busy  schedule  discourage  you from  making  some  great  changes  in the way you eat and live!   A. Try new things  B. Ability  is easily  improved  C. Make  three  or four instead  D. Understand  your food better  E. Cooking  is a burden  for many  people  F. Let cooking  and living  simply  be a joy rather  than a burden  G. A little time planning  ahead  can save a lot of work  later on<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, best_of=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=-1, min_p=0.0, seed=None, use_beam_search=False, length_penalty=1.0, early_stopping=False, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=512, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None), prompt_token_ids: [151644, 8948, 198, 2610, 525, 264, 10950, 17847, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 872, 198, 56568, 101909, 22574, 101057, 3837, 100638, 31838, 89012, 106367, 14582, 25, 51461, 117, 16038, 99534, 16744, 43815, 41175, 45181, 99534, 16744, 104813, 109487, 15946, 115751, 26232, 68756, 17254, 107762, 44290, 108721, 109487, 59133, 109487, 105656, 112794, 17714, 115916, 109487, 1773, 220, 25704, 220, 369, 17233, 220, 389, 264, 74346, 220, 23512, 220, 5542, 220, 847, 3139, 1154, 1052, 220, 525, 2326, 220, 1887, 220, 7966, 220, 3170, 1251, 220, 1513, 1405, 4296, 220, 803, 220, 3545, 549, 5726, 1154, 3220, 220, 323, 882, 11, 220, 22441, 220, 18, 21, 256, 22441, 17633, 220, 374, 264, 8544, 220, 358, 4700, 3581, 369, 2441, 220, 1899, 13, 2055, 3351, 220, 358, 1366, 220, 311, 2968, 498, 1045, 220, 23389, 220, 911, 220, 1246, 311, 1281, 220, 279, 1429, 220, 315, 279, 882, 498, 8329, 220, 304, 279, 9780, 659, 5692, 220, 525, 2326, 220, 10414, 369, 2244, 220, 17233, 220, 389, 264, 10296, 9700, 549, 220, 48312, 254, 38687, 220, 8305, 659, 576, 13943, 220, 979, 220, 358, 1744, 220, 17233, 220, 374, 264, 6646, 525, 979, 220, 358, 4249, 2669, 220, 28956, 220, 323, 1052, 220, 374, 4302, 220, 5527, 220, 311, 8180, 13, 2055, 1744, 220, 911, 220, 315, 279, 5001, 220, 2003, 659, 3197, 220, 686, 498, 614, 220, 882, 311, 4296, 937, 3155, 498, 614, 220, 279, 1290, 220, 7236, 220, 5527, 937, 220, 22441, 220, 18, 22, 256, 22441, 220, 48312, 94, 8078, 220, 697, 882, 5802, 220, 432, 13, 3197, 220, 498, 653, 1477, 882, 311, 4296, 220, 264, 15145, 1154, 1281, 220, 279, 1429, 220, 315, 432, 323, 3581, 6133, 220, 882, 2937, 389, 13, 8713, 498, 3259, 220, 825, 76148, 315, 16002, 937, 220, 22441, 220, 18, 23, 256, 22441, 432, 4990, 220, 2163, 220, 279, 1852, 220, 3311, 220, 315, 882, 311, 1281, 220, 803, 220, 315, 2494, 659, 2055, 3581, 6133, 220, 279, 5041, 220, 369, 264, 3853, 220, 15145, 659, 220, 48312, 95, 22441, 220, 18, 24, 256, 22441, 1096, 1231, 12761, 220, 498, 11, 714, 825, 315, 279, 1850, 7375, 220, 369, 3259, 220, 17233, 220, 5802, 220, 697, 882, 374, 65096, 659, 1084, 6696, 220, 498, 279, 6012, 220, 311, 4201, 5193, 220, 501, 6708, 220, 323, 18627, 220, 429, 646, 975, 220, 1632, 448, 697, 37475, 220, 323, 9700, 659, 576, 803, 220, 498, 3960, 220, 323, 279, 803, 220, 498, 1430, 11, 279, 803, 220, 5726, 220, 498, 614, 220, 311, 1896, 2524, 220, 315, 697, 3607, 323, 697, 9700, 659, 37894, 220, 429, 6696, 220, 498, 264, 1661, 220, 1191, 13, 220, 22441, 220, 19, 15, 256, 22441, 323, 1513, 1405, 1077, 264, 13028, 220, 9700, 220, 64987, 220, 498, 504, 220, 3259, 220, 1045, 220, 2244, 220, 4344, 220, 304, 279, 1616, 498, 8180, 323, 3887, 0, 256, 362, 13, 9735, 501, 2513, 220, 425, 13, 35983, 220, 374, 6707, 220, 12944, 220, 356, 13, 7405, 220, 2326, 220, 476, 3040, 4518, 220, 422, 13, 70894, 220, 697, 3607, 2664, 220, 468, 13, 56310, 220, 374, 264, 22305, 220, 369, 1657, 220, 1251, 220, 434, 13, 6771, 17233, 220, 323, 5382, 220, 4936, 220, 387, 264, 15888, 4751, 220, 1091, 264, 22305, 220, 479, 13, 362, 2632, 882, 9115, 220, 8305, 220, 646, 3581, 264, 2696, 315, 975, 220, 2937, 389, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198], lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

But you can’t  be successful  when  there’s  a lack of trust in a relationship  that results  from  an action  where  the wrongdoer  takes  no responsibility  to fix the mistake.   Unfortunately,  we’ve  all been  victims  of betrayal.  Whether  we’ve  been  stolen  from,  lied to, misled,  or cheated  on, there  are different  levels  of losing  trust . Sometimes  people  simply  can’t trust  anymore . 37. __________  It’s understandable,  but if you’re  willing  to build  trust in a relationship  again,  we have  some  steps  you can take to get you there.   ◆38. ___________  Having  confidence  in yourself  will help you make  better  choices  because  you can see what  the best outcome  would  be for your well-being.   \uf06c ◆39. ___________  If you’ve  been  betrayed,  you are the victim  of your circumstance.  But there’s  a difference  between  being  a victim  and living  with a “victim  mentality ”. At some  point  in all of our lives,  we’ll  have  our trust tested  or violated.   \uf06c ◆You didn’t  lose “everything ”. Once  trust is lost, what  is left? Instead  of looking  at the situation  from  this hopeless  angle , look  at everything  you still have  and be thankful  for all of the good  in your  life. 40. ___________  Instead,  it’s a healthy  way to work  through  the experience  to allow  room  for positive  growth  and   forgiveness.   A. Learn  to really  trust yourself.   B. It is putting  confidence  in someone.   C. Stop regarding  yourself  as the victim.   D. Remember  that you can expect  the best in return.   E. They’ve  been  too badly  hurt and they can’t  bear to let it happen  again.   F. This knowledge  carries  over in their attitude  toward  their future  relationships.   G. Seeing  the positive  side of things  doesn’t  mean  you’re  ignoring  what  happened.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, best_of=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=-1, min_p=0.0, seed=None, use_beam_search=False, length_penalty=1.0, early_stopping=False, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=512, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None), prompt_token_ids: [151644, 8948, 198, 2610, 525, 264, 10950, 17847, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 872, 198, 56568, 101909, 22574, 101057, 3837, 100638, 31838, 89012, 106367, 14582, 25, 51461, 117, 16038, 99534, 16744, 43815, 41175, 45181, 99534, 16744, 104813, 109487, 15946, 115751, 26232, 68756, 17254, 107762, 44290, 108721, 109487, 59133, 109487, 105656, 112794, 17714, 115916, 109487, 1773, 256, 16858, 220, 16816, 220, 304, 264, 32807, 220, 13759, 220, 16816, 220, 374, 264, 9498, 220, 7709, 220, 429, 582, 8722, 504, 220, 3267, 11449, 13, 220, 220, 18, 21, 13, 3979, 5973, 220, 16816, 220, 374, 264, 5214, 13, 1988, 498, 646, 1405, 220, 387, 6849, 220, 979, 220, 1052, 748, 220, 264, 6853, 315, 6950, 304, 264, 5025, 220, 429, 3059, 220, 504, 220, 458, 1917, 220, 1380, 220, 279, 4969, 2982, 261, 220, 4990, 220, 902, 11752, 220, 311, 5046, 279, 16523, 13, 256, 18656, 11, 220, 582, 3982, 220, 678, 1012, 220, 12415, 220, 315, 67276, 13, 220, 13139, 220, 582, 3982, 220, 1012, 220, 22329, 220, 504, 11, 220, 46153, 311, 11, 98425, 11, 220, 476, 77678, 220, 389, 11, 1052, 220, 525, 2155, 220, 5866, 220, 315, 13188, 220, 6950, 659, 17688, 220, 1251, 220, 4936, 220, 646, 1405, 6950, 220, 14584, 659, 220, 18, 22, 13, 1304, 3979, 220, 1084, 748, 48739, 11, 220, 714, 421, 498, 3129, 220, 9831, 220, 311, 1936, 220, 6950, 304, 264, 5025, 220, 1549, 11, 220, 582, 614, 220, 1045, 220, 7354, 220, 498, 646, 1896, 311, 633, 498, 1052, 13, 256, 55729, 228, 18, 23, 13, 1304, 3979, 62, 220, 20035, 220, 12136, 220, 304, 6133, 220, 686, 1492, 498, 1281, 220, 2664, 220, 11454, 220, 1576, 220, 498, 646, 1490, 1128, 220, 279, 1850, 15274, 220, 1035, 220, 387, 369, 697, 1632, 32751, 13, 256, 32495, 223, 105, 55729, 228, 18, 24, 13, 1304, 3979, 62, 220, 1416, 498, 3982, 220, 1012, 220, 64297, 11, 220, 498, 525, 279, 11734, 220, 315, 697, 52137, 13, 220, 1988, 1052, 748, 220, 264, 6672, 220, 1948, 220, 1660, 220, 264, 11734, 220, 323, 5382, 220, 448, 264, 1036, 90939, 220, 48295, 18987, 13, 2411, 1045, 220, 1459, 220, 304, 678, 315, 1039, 6305, 11, 220, 582, 4700, 220, 614, 220, 1039, 6950, 12510, 220, 476, 33421, 13, 256, 32495, 223, 105, 55729, 228, 2610, 3207, 1405, 220, 9052, 1036, 72726, 18987, 13, 9646, 220, 6950, 374, 5558, 11, 1128, 220, 374, 2115, 30, 12090, 220, 315, 3330, 220, 518, 279, 6534, 220, 504, 220, 419, 74223, 220, 9210, 1154, 1401, 220, 518, 4297, 220, 498, 2058, 614, 220, 323, 387, 42688, 220, 369, 678, 315, 279, 1661, 220, 304, 697, 220, 2272, 13, 220, 19, 15, 13, 1304, 3979, 62, 220, 12090, 11, 220, 432, 748, 264, 9314, 220, 1616, 311, 975, 220, 1526, 220, 279, 3139, 220, 311, 2138, 220, 3054, 220, 369, 6785, 220, 6513, 220, 323, 256, 52050, 13, 256, 362, 13, 14934, 220, 311, 2167, 220, 6950, 6133, 13, 256, 425, 13, 1084, 374, 10687, 220, 12136, 220, 304, 4325, 13, 256, 356, 13, 14215, 8826, 220, 6133, 220, 438, 279, 11734, 13, 256, 422, 13, 19881, 220, 429, 498, 646, 1720, 220, 279, 1850, 304, 470, 13, 256, 468, 13, 2379, 3982, 220, 1012, 220, 2238, 24569, 220, 12898, 323, 807, 646, 1405, 220, 11722, 311, 1077, 432, 3537, 220, 1549, 13, 256, 434, 13, 1096, 6540, 220, 23377, 220, 916, 304, 862, 18915, 220, 8841, 220, 862, 3853, 220, 11871, 13, 256, 479, 13, 55024, 220, 279, 6785, 220, 3108, 315, 2513, 220, 3171, 1405, 220, 3076, 220, 498, 3129, 220, 30903, 220, 1128, 220, 6932, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198], lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

The science  of creating  and reading  coded  messages  is called  cryptography.  There  are three  main  types  of cryptography.     37    For example,  the first letters  of “My elephant  eats too many  eels”  spell out the hidden  message  “Meet  me.”     38    You might  represent  each letter  with a number,  for example.  Let’s  number  the letters  of the alphabet,  in order,  from  1 to 26. If we substitute  a number  for each letter,  the message  “Meet  me” would  read “13 5 5 20 13 5.” A code  uses symbols  to replace  words,  phrases,  or sentences.  To read the message  of a real code,  you must  have  a code  book.     39    For example,  “bridge”  might  stand  for “meet”  and “out”  might  stand  for “me.”  The message    “Bridge  out” would  actually  mean  “Meet  me.”     40    However,  it is also hard to keep  a code  book  secret  for long.  So codes  must  be changed  frequently.  A. It is very hard to break  a code  without  the code  book.  B. In any language,  some  letters  are used more  than others.  C. Only  people  who know  the keyword  can read the message.  D. As long as there  have  been  codes,  people  have  tried to break  them.  E. You can hide a message  by having  the first letters  of each word  spell  it out. F. With  a code  book,  you might  write  down  words  that would  stand  for other  words.  G. Another  way to hide a message  is to use symbols  to stand  for specific  letters  of the alphabet.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, best_of=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=-1, min_p=0.0, seed=None, use_beam_search=False, length_penalty=1.0, early_stopping=False, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=512, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None), prompt_token_ids: [151644, 8948, 198, 2610, 525, 264, 10950, 17847, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 872, 198, 56568, 101909, 22574, 101057, 3837, 100638, 31838, 89012, 106367, 14582, 25, 51461, 117, 16038, 99534, 16744, 43815, 41175, 45181, 99534, 16744, 104813, 109487, 15946, 115751, 26232, 68756, 17254, 107762, 44290, 108721, 109487, 41175, 109487, 105656, 112794, 17714, 115916, 109487, 1773, 220, 8599, 220, 13912, 220, 320, 32867, 873, 2506, 220, 6605, 220, 869, 659, 37766, 11, 220, 5110, 11, 220, 323, 3033, 220, 13304, 220, 990, 6234, 220, 13912, 220, 304, 3730, 220, 2562, 11, 220, 5310, 220, 979, 220, 1995, 220, 374, 3208, 553, 6366, 13, 220, 8853, 220, 614, 220, 1483, 6234, 220, 13912, 220, 369, 9037, 220, 315, 1635, 13, 257, 220, 18, 21, 262, 6119, 220, 14719, 220, 2581, 220, 326, 2032, 320, 105983, 873, 3041, 4815, 220, 2038, 220, 3259, 13, 220, 576, 8038, 220, 315, 6825, 220, 323, 5290, 220, 46673, 220, 6605, 220, 374, 2598, 220, 86837, 13, 220, 2619, 220, 525, 2326, 220, 1887, 220, 4494, 220, 315, 86837, 13, 257, 220, 18, 22, 262, 1752, 3110, 11, 220, 279, 1156, 11931, 220, 315, 1036, 5050, 45740, 220, 49677, 2238, 1657, 220, 384, 2010, 854, 220, 12845, 700, 279, 8177, 220, 1943, 220, 1036, 40551, 220, 752, 1987, 257, 220, 18, 23, 262, 1446, 2578, 220, 4009, 220, 1817, 6524, 220, 448, 264, 1372, 11, 220, 369, 3110, 13, 220, 6771, 748, 220, 1372, 220, 279, 11931, 220, 315, 279, 27790, 11, 220, 304, 1973, 11, 220, 504, 220, 220, 16, 311, 220, 17, 21, 13, 1416, 582, 27679, 220, 264, 1372, 220, 369, 1817, 6524, 11, 220, 279, 1943, 220, 1036, 40551, 220, 752, 854, 1035, 220, 1349, 1036, 16, 18, 220, 20, 220, 20, 220, 17, 15, 220, 16, 18, 220, 20, 1987, 362, 2038, 220, 5711, 17738, 220, 311, 8290, 220, 4244, 11, 220, 31747, 11, 220, 476, 22870, 13, 220, 2014, 1349, 279, 1943, 220, 315, 264, 1931, 2038, 11, 220, 498, 1969, 220, 614, 220, 264, 2038, 220, 2311, 13, 257, 220, 18, 24, 262, 1752, 3110, 11, 220, 1036, 13709, 854, 220, 2578, 220, 2498, 220, 369, 1036, 63410, 854, 220, 323, 1036, 411, 854, 220, 2578, 220, 2498, 220, 369, 1036, 2660, 1987, 220, 576, 1943, 262, 1036, 32848, 220, 700, 854, 1035, 220, 3520, 220, 3076, 220, 1036, 40551, 220, 752, 1987, 257, 220, 19, 15, 262, 4354, 11, 220, 432, 374, 1083, 2588, 311, 2506, 220, 264, 2038, 220, 2311, 220, 6234, 220, 369, 1293, 13, 220, 2055, 13912, 220, 1969, 220, 387, 5497, 220, 13814, 13, 220, 362, 13, 1084, 374, 1602, 2588, 311, 1438, 220, 264, 2038, 220, 2041, 220, 279, 2038, 220, 2311, 13, 220, 425, 13, 758, 894, 4128, 11, 220, 1045, 220, 11931, 220, 525, 1483, 803, 220, 1091, 3800, 13, 220, 356, 13, 8278, 220, 1251, 220, 879, 1414, 220, 279, 16174, 220, 646, 1349, 279, 1943, 13, 220, 422, 13, 1634, 1293, 438, 1052, 220, 614, 220, 1012, 220, 13912, 11, 220, 1251, 220, 614, 220, 6679, 311, 1438, 220, 1105, 13, 220, 468, 13, 1446, 646, 10265, 264, 1943, 220, 553, 3432, 220, 279, 1156, 11931, 220, 315, 1817, 3409, 220, 12845, 220, 432, 700, 13, 434, 13, 3085, 220, 264, 2038, 220, 2311, 11, 220, 498, 2578, 220, 3270, 220, 1495, 220, 4244, 220, 429, 1035, 220, 2498, 220, 369, 1008, 220, 4244, 13, 220, 479, 13, 13293, 220, 1616, 311, 10265, 264, 1943, 220, 374, 311, 990, 17738, 220, 311, 2498, 220, 369, 3151, 220, 11931, 220, 315, 279, 27790, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198], lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

But it doesn’t  happen  by accident.  It starts  with looking  inside  yourself  and understanding  who you are with respect  to the natural  world  and how you approach  the gardening  process.  ●   37    Some  people  may think  that a garden  is no more  than plants,  flowers,  patterns  and masses  of color.  Others  are concerned  about  using  gardening  methods  that require  less water  and fewer  fertilizers  (肥料 ).    38   . However,  there  are a number  of other  reasons  that might  explain  why you want  to garden.  One of them  comes  from  our earliest  years.  ●Recall(回忆 ) your childhood  memories  Our model  of what  a garden  should  be often  goes back  to childhood.  Grandma’s  rose garden  and Dad’s  vegetable  garden  might  be good  or bad, but that’s  not what’s  important.     39    ― how being  in those  gardens  made  us feel. If you’d  like to build  a powerful  bond  with your garden,  start by taking  some  time to recall  the gardens  of your youth.     40   . Then  go outside  and work  out a plan to translate    your childhood  memories  into your grown-up  garden.  Have  fun. A. Know  why you garden  B. Find a good  place  for your own garden  C.

Americans eat only about fifteen pounds of fish per person per year, but we eat twice as much fish in restaurants as at home. Buying, storing, and cooking fish isn’t difficult.    37    This text is about how to buy and cook fish in an easy way.   38    Fresh fish should smell sweet: you should feel that you’re standing at the ocean’s edge. Any fishy or strong smell means the fish isn’t fresh.    39    When you have bought a fish and arrive home, you’d better store the fish in the refrigerator if you don’t cook it immediately, but fresh fish should be stored in your fridge for only a day or two. Frozen fish isn’t as tasty as the fresh one.There\xa0are\xa0many\xa0common\xa0methods\xa0used\xa0to\xa0cook\xa0fish.\xa0\xa0  40\xa0 \xa0 First, clean it and season it with your choice of spices (调料). Put the whole fish on a plate and steam it in a steam pot for 8 to 10 minutes if it weighs about one pound. (A larger one will take more time.) Then, it’s ready to serve.A. Do not buy it.B. The easiest is to steam it.C. This is how you can do it.D. It just requires a little knowledge.E. The fish will go bad within hours.F. When buying fish, you should first smell it.G.

I would  have  laughed  heartily.  Campers,  in my eyes,  were  people  who enjoyed  insect  bites,  ill-cooked  meals,  and uncomfortable  sleeping  bags.  They  had nothing  in common  with me.     36    . The friends  who introduced  me to camping  thought  that it meant  to be a pioneer.     37    We sleep  in a tent, cooked  over an open  fire, and walked  a long distance  to take the shower  and use the bathroom.  This brief  visit with Mother  Nature  cost me two days off from  work,  recovering  from  a bad case of sunburn  and the doctor’s  bill for my son’s  food poisoning.  I was, nevertheless,  talked  into going  on another  fun-filled  holiday  in the wilderness.    38    Instead,  we had a pop-up  camper  with comfortable  beds and an air conditioner.  My nature-loving  friends  had remembered  to bring  all the necessities  of life.    39    We have  done  a lot of it since.  Recently,  we bought  a twenty-eight-foot  travel  trailer  complete  with a bathroom  and a built-in  TV set. There  is a separate  bedroom,  a modern  kitchen  with a refrigerator.  The trailer  even  has matching  carpet  and curtains.     40     It must  be true that sooner  or later,  everyone  finds  his or her way back  to nature.  I recommend  that you find your way in style.  A. This time there  was no tent. B. Things  are going  to be improved.  C. The trip they took me on was a rough  one. D. I was to learn  a lot about  camping  since  then,  however.  E. I must  say that I have  certainly  come  to enjoy  camping.     F. After  the trip, my family  became  quite  interested  in camping.  G.

In fact, the key to easy morning wake-up lies in resting your body clock   36     Here is how to make one.●    37     In order to make a change, you need to decide why it’s important. Do you want to get up in time to have breakfast with your family, get in some exercise, or just be better prepared for your day? Once you are clear about your reason, tell your family or roommates about the change you want to make.Rethink mornings. Now that you know why you want to wake up, consider re-arranging your morning activities. If you want time to have breakfast with your family, save some time the night before by setting out clothes, shoes, and bags.    38   That’s a quarter-hour more you could be sleeping if you bought a coffee maker with a timer.Keep your sleep/wake schedule on weekends. If you’re tired out by Friday night, sleeping in on Saturday could sound wonderful. But compensating on the weekends actually feeds into your sleepiness the following week, a recent study found.   39   Keep a record and evaluate it weekly. Keep track of your efforts and write down how you feel. After you’ve tried a new method for a week, take a look at your record.    40    If not, take another look at other methods you could try.A.

A grasp  of how to manage  color  in your spaces  is one of the first steps  to creating  rooms  you’ll  love to live in. Do you want  a room  that’s  full of life? Professional?  Or are you just looking  for a place  to relax  after a long day?    36   , color  is the key to making  a room  feel the way you want  it to feel. Over  the years,  there  have  been  a number  of different  techniques  to help   designers  approach  this important  point.     37   , they can get a little complex.  But good  news  is that there’re  really  only three  kinds  of decisions  you need  to make  about  color  in your home:  the small  ones,  the medium  ones,  and the large  ones.     38   . They’re  the little spots  of color  like throw  pillows,  mirrors  and baskets  that most  of us use to add visual  interest  to our rooms.  Less tiring  than painting  your walls  and less expensive  than buying  a colorful  sofa,  small  color  choices  bring  with them  the significant  benefit  of being  easily  changeable.  Medium  color  choices  are generally  furniture  pieces  such  as sofas , dinner  tables  or bookshelves     39   . They  require  a bigger  commitment  than smaller  ones , and they have  a more  powerful  effect  on the feeling  of a space.  The large  color  decisions  in your  rooms  concern  the walls , ceilings , and floors . Whether  you’re looking  at wallpaper  or paint , the time, effort  and relative  expense  put into it are significant .    40   . A. While  all of them  are useful   B.

With  such busy  lives,  it can be hard to try and find the time to work  out.   36   Working  out in the morning  provides  additional  benefits  beyond  being  physically  fit. ● Your  productivity  is improved.  Exercising  makes  you more  awake  and ready  to handle  whatever  is ahead  of you for the day.   37   ● Your  metabolism  (新陈代谢 ) gets a head  start.    38   If you work  out in the mornings,  then you will be getting  the calorie  (卡路里 ) burning  benefits  for the whole  day, not in your sleep.  ●   39   Studies  found  that people  who woke  up early  for exercise  slept  better  than those  who exercised  in the evening.  Exercise  energizes  you, so it is more  difficult  to relax  and have  a peaceful  sleep  when  you are very excited.  ●   40   If you work  out bright  and early  in the morning,  you will be more  likely  to stick  to healthy  food choices  throughout  the day.

Dance expresses love and hate, joy and sorrow, life and death, and everything else in between.\t    36    We dance from Florida to Alaska, from north to south and sea to sea. We dance at weddings, birthdays, office parties and just to fill the time.\t“I adore dancing,” says Lester Bridges, the owner of a dance studio in Iowa. “I can’t imagine doing anything else with my life.” Bridges runs dance classes for all ages. “Teaching dance is wonderful.    37    It’s great to watch them. For many of them, it’s a way of meeting people and having a social life.”\t   38    “I can tell you about one young couple,” says Bridges. “They’re learning to do traditional dances. They arrive at the class in low spirits and they leave with a smile.      39    ”\tSo, do we dance in order to make ourselves feel better, calmer, healthier? Andrea Hillier says, “Dance, like the pattern of a beating heart, is life. Even after all these years, I want to get better and better.   40     I find it hard to stop! Dancing reminds me I’m alive.”A. So why do we dance?B. Dance in the U.S. is everywhere.C. If you like dancing outdoors, come to America.D. My older students say it makes them feel young.E. I keep practicing even When I’m extremely tired.F. Dancing seems to change their feeling completely.G.

If you exercise out of doors，your body will learn to breathe more deeply，allowing even more oxygen to get to your muscles(肌肉)and your brain.Recently，people have begun studying the connection between the natural world and healing(治愈). _____38_____ In these places patients can go to be near nature during their recovery. It turns out that just looking at green，growing things can reduce stress，lower blood pressure，and put people into a better mood(情绪).Greenery is good for us. Hospital patients Who see tree branches out their window are likely to recover at a faster rate than patients who see buildings or sky instead. ______39______ It gives us a great feeling of peace.___40___While the sun's rays can age and harm our skin, they also give is beneficial Vitamin D. To make sure you get enough Vitamin D—but still protect your skin— put on sunscreen right as you head outside. It takes sunscreen about fifteen minutes to start working, and that's plenty of time for your skin to absorb a day's worth of Vitamin D.A. Fresh air cleans our lungs.B. So what are you waiting for?C.

But at times it seems too difficult and too far out of reach. ___36___ Here’s a handful of ways that will set you in the right direction.●___37___ Do not follow the people who make you feel not-good-enough. Why do you follow them? Are you hoping that eventually you will feel empowered because your life is better than theirs? Know that your life is your own;you are the only you in this world.●Forgive yourself for mistakes that you have made. We are often ashamed of our shortcomings, our mistakes and our failures. ___38___ You will make mistakes, time and time again. Rather than getting caught up in how you could have done better, why not offer yourself a compassionate (有同情心) response? ＂That didn’t go as planned. But, I tried my best.＂●Recognize all of your strengths. Write them down in a journal. Begin to train your brain to look at strength before weakness. List all of your accomplishments and achievements. You have a job, earned your degree, and you got out of bed today. ___39___●Now that you’ve listed your strengths, list your imperfections. Turn the page in your journal. Put into words why you feel unworthy, why you don’t feel good enough. Now, read these words back to yourself. ___40___ Turn to a page in your journal to your list of strengths and achievements. See how awesome you are?A. Feeling upset again?B. Where do you start?C. Nothing is too small to celebrate.D. Remember, you are only human. E. Set an intention for self-acceptance.F. Stop comparing yourself with others.G.

The person who bought the house or moved is the one who throws the party. The party is a chance for friends and family to congratulate the person on the new home. ___36___ And it is good time to fill the new space with love and hopeful presents.___37___ Some people register a list of things they want or need for their new home at a local stores. Some common things people will put on a gift registry include kitchen tools like knives and things like curtains. Even if there isn’t a registry, a good housewarming gift is something to decorate the new house with, like a piece of art or a plant.___38___ This is often appreciated since at a housewarming there isn’t a lot of food served. There are usually no planned activities like games at a housewarming party. The host or hostess of the party will, however, probably give all the guests a tour of their new home. Sometimes, because a housewarming party happens shortly after a person moves into their new home, people may be asked to help unpack boxes. ___39___Housewarming parties get their name from the fact that a long time ago people would actually bring firewood to a new home as a gift. ___40___ Now most homes have central heating and don’t use fires to keep warm.A. This isn’t usual though.B. It is traditional to bring a gift to a housewarming party.C. You can also bring food or drinks to share with the other guests.D. If you’re lucky enough to receive gifts, keep them in a safe place.E. It also gives people a chance to see what the new home looks like.F. The best housewarming parties encourage old friends to get together.G.

So the main thing is just to show up and be adventurous, trying different foods and talking to strangers. People love to talk about themselves. If you can start the conversation with a question other than “What do you do for a living?”, you’ll be able to get a lot more interesting conversation out of whomever it is you’re talking to. ___37___, it can bring in “I have this old, broken-down vehicle” or “I rode the bus with these crazy people who were laughing at silly jokes in the back.” It just opens up conversation. ___38___? If you can’t take their wine away, you should certainly try to take away their soapbox （讲台）. If you’re the host, you can ask them to help you in the kitchen with something and just remove them from the situation.___39___.And what about that other dinner-party killer: awkward silence? If you’re faced with an awkward silence at a dinner party, the only thing that always gets everyone talking again is to give the host a compliment（赞扬）. ___40___. Just quickly turn around and say, “This cake is extremely delicious and you have to tell me all about it.”So being interesting at a dinner party isn’t that hard.A. How do you know the hostB.

But it doesn\'t end with bottles, cans, and paper. Clothing takes a huge amount of natural resources（资源）to make, and buying loads of new clothing（or throwing out old clothing）is not healthy for the environment. So what to do with all those perfectly-good-but-you\'re-maybe-a-little-sick-of-them clothes piled on your bedroom floor? ____16____. It\'s the best way to get rid of your used clothes, score clothes from your friends, and have a party all at the same time.A successful swap depends on the selection of clothes, the organization of the event, and, obviously, how much fun is had. It\'s really easy to do! Here are a few pointers. ●Invite 5—10 people so you have a nice selection. ____17____ , and there may not be enough things to choose from; more than that, and it becomes uncontrollable. ●____18____. They should also prepare plenty of reusable bags to carry their "new" clothes home. ●Put different types of clothing on different surfaces in the room.____19____. Place a few mirrors around your room so people can see how things look when they try them on. One of the ground rules of the swap should be that everyone must try on the clothes before they take them—things always look different when you put them on.●Set a starting time. Maybe you say “go,” or turn on a certain song, or whatever. ____20____. And don\'t forget to put out some cookies and fruits. Remember, it\'s a party!A. Less people than thatB. Hold a clothing swapC. If two people are competingD. Just keep music playing throughoutE. Donate whatever clothes are left overF. Have everyone put their clothes in the right spotsG.

Here are five ways to sustain (保持) long-distance friendships. ·Set a regular dateLong-lasting friendships share the characteristic that both sides equally contact (联系) and share with one another. With busy schedules, squeezing in phone calls can be a challenge. ___16___. ·More isn’t always merrierMake sure you have communicated with your friend about how frequently each of you wants to be contacted and what method works best for you both. ___17___. There are alternatives to constant written communication, such as leaving voice messages or having a group chat. ·Practise empathy (共情)___18___. The friend who is remaining needs to be sensitive to all the additional time demands placed on the friend who has moved. The one in the new environment should be sympathetic to the fact that your friend may feel abandoned. ·___19___Anniversaries and birthdays carry even more weight in long-distance friendships. Although technology might make day-to-day communication possible, extra effort goes a long way on special days. Simply keeping a diary that keeps track of friends’ birthdays and other important dates will make sure nothing slips by you. ·Don’t rely on technology alone___20___, but long-distance friendships — even close ones — may require more conscious effort to sustain. Try to seek out chances to renew friendships. How to do it? Just spend face-to-face time together whenever possible.A. Remember important datesB. Compensate by writing lettersC.

Well  before  classes  start, students  and teachers  order  Lattes , Cappuccinos  and Hot Chocolates . Then , during  the first period , teachers  call in orders  on their room  phones , and students  make  deliveries .     By closing  time at 9:20 a.m., the shop  usually  sells 90 drinks . “Whoever  made  the chi tea, Ms. Schatzman  says it was good ,” Christy  McKinley , a second  year student , announced  recently , after hanging  up with the teacher .     The shop  is called  the Dixie  PIT, which  stands  for Power  in Transition . Although  some  of the students  are not disabled , many  are, and the PIT helps  them  prepare  for life after high school .     They  learn  not only how to run a coffee  shop  but also how to deal with their affairs . They  keep  a timecard  and receive  paychecks , which  they keep  in check  registers .     Special -education  teachers  Kim Chevalier  and Sue Casey  introduced  the Dixie  PIT from  a similar  program  at Kennesaw  Mountain  High  School  in Georgia .

Should  schools  be selling  coffee ? What  about  sugar  content ?     Kenton  County  Food  Service  Director  Ginger  Gray  helped . She made  sure all the drinks , which  use non-fat milk, fell within  nutrition（营养） guidelines .     The whole  school  has joined  in to help.     Teachers  agreed  to give up their lounge（休息室） in the mornings . Art students  painted  the name  of the shop  on the wall. Business  students  designed  the paychecks . The basketball  team  helped  pay for cups. 59. What  is the text mainly  about？\u3000   \u3000 A. A best-selling  coffee .             B. A special  educational  program . C.

Any owner  will tall you how much  joy a pet brings . For some , an animal  provides  more  comfort  than a husband/wife . A 2002  study  by Karen  Allen  of the State  University  of New  York  measured  stress（紧张） levels  and blood  pressure  in people  --- half of them  pet owners  --- while  they performed  5 minutes  of mental  arithmetic （算术） or held a hand  in ice water . Subjects  completed  the tasks  alone , with a husband/wife , a close  friend  or with a pet. People  with pets did it best. Those  tested  with their animal  friends  had smaller  change  in blood  pressure  and returned  most  quickly  to baseline  heart  rates . With  pets in the room , people  also made  fewer  math  mistakes  than when  doing  in front  of other  companions . It seems  people  feel more  relaxed（放松） around  pets, says Allen , who thinks  it may be because  pets don’t judge . A study  reported  last fall suggests  that having  a pet dog not only raises  your spirits  but may also have  an effect  on your eating  habits . Researchers  at Northwestern  Memorial  Hospital  spent  a year studying  36 fat people  and their equally  fat dogs  on diet-and-exercise  programs ; a separate  group  of 56 people  without  pets were  put on a diet program . On average , people  lost about  I1 pounds , or 5% of their body  weight . Their  dogs  did even  better , losing  an average  of 12 pounds , more  than 15% of their body  weight . Dog owners  didn’t lose any more  weight  than those  without  dogs  but, say researchers , got more  exercise  overall  --- mostly  with their dogs  --- and found  it worth  doing . 67. What  does the text mainly  discuss？\u3000   \u3000 A. What  pets bring  to their owners .      B. How  pets help people  calm  down . C. People ’s opinions  of keeping  pets.    D. Pet’s value  in medical  research . 68. We learn  from  the text that a person  with heart  disease  has a better  chance  of getting  well if\u3000   \u3000. A. he has a pet companion                B. he has less stress  of work  C. he often  does mental  arithmetic          D. he is taken  care of by his family  69. According  to Allen , why did the people  do better  with pets around  when  facing    stressful  tasks ? \u3000   \u3000 A. They  have  lower  blood  pressure .     B. They  become  more  patient . C. They  are less nervous .             D. They  are in higher  spirits . 70. The research  mentioned  in the last paragraph  reports  that\u3000   \u3000.

I stared  at everything  as if I was looking  at it for the first time. The day passed  fast and I even  forgot  to have  my lunch  until I felt hungry . I looked  at my watch  and was surprised  that it was 3:00 pm. Soon  the train pulled  up at   Butterworth . I looked  at the people  all around  me. They  all looked  beautiful . When  my uncle  arrived  with a smile , I threw  my arms  around  him to give him a warm  hug （ 拥 抱 ） . I had never  done  this before . He seemed  surprised  and then his weather -beaten  face warmed  up with a huge  smile . We walked  arm in arm to his car. I looked  forward  to the return  journey . 71.

Brownie , in return , loved  each and every  one of us. One thing  that most  touched  my heart  was that she would  go to whoever  was sick and just be with them . We always  felt better  when  she was around .  One days, as I was getting  her food, she chewed  up（咬破） one of Dad’s shoes , which  had to be thrown  away  in the end. I knew  Dad would  be mad and I had to let her know  what  she did was Wrong . When  I looked  at her and said, “Bad girl. ” She looked  down  at the ground  and then went  and hid. I saw a tear in her eyes.    Brownie  turned  out to be more  than just our family  pet. She went  everywhere  with us. People  would  stop and ask if they could  pet her. Of course  she’d let anyone  pet her. She was just the most  lovable  dog. There  were  many  dines  when  we’d be out walking  and a small  child  would  come  over and pull on her hair.

Hey, stop!  This is no vacation ---yon have  to finish  something!    Here  lies the problem  fat travel  writer  and food critic（评论家） Edie Jarolim . “I always  loved  traveling  and always  liked  to eat, but it never  occurred  to me that I could  make  money  doing  both of those  things . ” Jarolim  said. Now  you can read her travel  advice  everywhere  --- in Arts and Antiques , in Brides , or in one of her three  books .  The Complete  Idiot  Travel  Guide  to Mexico ’s Beach  Resorts .  Her job in travel  writing  began  Some  eight  years  ago. After  getting  a PhD in English  in Canada , she took a test for Frommer ’s travel  guides , passed  it, and got the job.

S. that she moved  there .  Now  as a travel  writer , she spends  one-third  of her year on the road. The rest of the time is spent  completing  her tasks  and writing  reviews  of restaurants  at home  in Tucson , Arizona .  As adventurous  as the job sounds , the hard part is fact --- checking  all the information .

Never  mind  that Beijing ’s dry weather  seldom  produces  snow . It is cold enough  in winter  for snow  --- making  machines  to make  a covering  for the hills north  to the capital . And the rapid  growth  of a pleasure  --- seeking  middle  class  has formed  the basis  for this new craze（热潮） .  Since  Beijing ’s first ski resort  was opened  ten years  ago, the sport  has enjoyed  astonishing  increase . There  are now more  than a dozen  resorts . Clothes  markets  in the city have  added  bright  colored  ski suits to their winter  collections . Mr. Wei, a manager  of a newly -opened  ski resort  in Beijing , sees the growth  of an industry  that could  soon  lead Chinese  to head  for the ski resorts  of Europe . In recent  years  ski resorts  offering  natural  snow  have  opened  in China . But many  are in faraway  areas  of the country  and can’t really  match  the equipment  and services  of some  ski resorts  in Europe .  Beijing ’s skiing  craze  is partly  a result  of the recent  increase  in private（私有的） cars. This has led to the growth  of a leisure  industry  in the capital ’s suburbs（郊区）, which  until the late-1990s  were  unreachable  to ordinary  people . According  to Mr.  Wei, about  40% of the visitors  to his resort  come  in their own cars. The rest are bused  in by schools , businesses  or government  offices .  The problem  is making  money . Starting  ski resorts  requires  quite  a lot of money ;  hiring  land from  the local  government , preparing  the hills, buying  snow  machines , making  sure there  are enough  water  and electricity  to run them , and buying  ski equipment  for hiring  out to customers .  The ski resort  where  Mr. Wei works  cost nearly  $4m to set up. And as so often  in China  when  someone  comes  up with a good  idea, many  others  hash in and price  wars  break  out. Beijing  now offers  some  of the cheapest  ski training  classes  in the world , though  with most  people  rather  new to the sport , expecting  a few more  doing  the same    job.  50.

All we assume（推测） is that some  early  men invented  certain  sounds , in one way or another , to express  thoughts  and feelings , actions  and things , so that they could  talk with each other . Later  they agreed  upon  certain  signs , called  letters , which  could  be put together  to show  those  sounds , and which  could  be written  down . Those  sounds , whether  spoken  or written  in letters , are called  words .  The power  of words , then, lies in their associations ---the things  they bring  up to our minds . Words  become  filled  with meaning  for us by experience ; and the longer  we tire, the more  certain  words  bring  back  to us the happy  and sad events  of our past; and the more  we read and learn , the more  the number  of words  that mean  something  to us increases .  Great  writers  are those  who not only have  great  thoughts  but also express  these  thoughts  in words  which  have  powerful  effects  on our minds  and feelings . This clever  use of words  is what  we call literary  style（文体） . Above  all, the real poet is a master  of words . He can express  his meaning  in words  which  sing like music , and which  by their position  and association  can move  men to tears . We should  therefore  learn  to choose  our words  carefully  and use them  correctly , or they will make  our speech  silly and common .  58. We learn  from  the text that language  might  have  begun  with\u3000   \u3000. A. expressions          B. actions         C. signs            D. sounds  59. What  is mainly  discussed  in Paragraph  2? \u3000   \u3000 A. The learning  of new words .  B. The importance  of old words  C. The relation  of human  experience  with words .  D. The gradual  change  and development  of words .  60. In the last paragraph , what  does the author  suggest  that we should  do? \u3000   \u3000 A. Use words  skillfully .            B. Make  musical  speeches  C. Learn  poems  by heart .           D.

One by one, graffiti -covered  walls  are being  changed  into outdoor  art. So far, more  than 1,800murals （壁画） have  been  painted . Philadelphia  now has more  murals  than any other  American  city. The walls  that were  once  ugly with graffiti（涂鸦） are now covered  with beautiful  pictures  of historical  heroes  and modern  art, thanks  to the Mural  Arts Program  （MAP）. Its work  makes  schools  and public  places  attractive , and its citizens  very proud . The program  began  as part of Philadelphia ’s Anti-Graffiti  Network . Jane Golden  is the MAP ’s artistic  director . “When  people  ask me what  our program  is about ,” she says, “I answer  them  with one word : hope .” Each  year, the MAP  offers  youth  art programs  and workshops . Some  one-time graffiti  writers  even    help paint  MAP  murals . The MAP ’s work , says Golden , is all about  developing  a sense  of community （社区） . When  a neighborhood  requests  a mural , the MAP  works  with the people  there  to develop  a message . Some  messages  have  been  “Safe Streets ,” “Love  and Care ,” and “Peace  Walk .” The MAP  receives  up to 50 requests  for murals  each week . Last year, the workers  painted  140 murals . “The making  of a mural  enters  people ’s collective  memory  as an extraordinary , pleasant  moment  in neighborhood  history ” says Golden , who began  as a muralist  in Los Angeles . 41.

An animal  that is aware（意识）of itself  has a high level  of intelligence .   Awareness  can be tested  by studying  whether  the animal  recognizes  itself  in the mirror , that is, its own reflected  image（反射出的影像） . Many  animals  fail this exercise  bitterly , paying  very little attention  to the reflected  image . Only  humans , and some  intelligent  animals  like apes and dolphins , have  shown  to recognize  that the image  in the mirror  is of themselves . Now  another  animal  has joined  the club. In the Proceedings  of the National  Academy  of Sciences , researchers  report  that an Asian  elephant  has passed  the mirror  self-reflection  test. “We thought  that elephants  were  the next important  animal ,” said Dinana  Reiss  of the Wildlife  Conservation  Society , an author  of the study  with Joshua  M. Plotnik  and Fans  B.M. de Waal  of Emory  University . With  their large  brains , Reiss  said, elephants  “seemed  like cousins  to apes and dolphins .” The researchers  tested  Happy , Maxine  and Patty , three  elephants  at the Bronx  Zoo. They  put an 8-foot-square  mirror  on a wall of the animals ’ play area（out of the sight  of zoo visitors）and recorded  what  happened  with cameras , including  one built in the mirror . The elephants  used their long noses  to find what  was behind  it, and to examine  parts  of their bodies . Of the three , Happy  then passed  the test, in which  a clear  mark  was painted  on one side of her face. She could  tell the mark  was there  by looking  in the mirror , and she used the mirror  to touch  the mark  with her long nose. Diana  Reiss  said, “We knew  elephants  were  intelligent , but now we can talk about  their intelligence  in a better  way.” 45. What  can mirror  tests tell us about  animals ? \u3000   \u3000 A. Whether  they have  large  brains . B. Whether  they have  self-awareness . C. Whether  they enjoy  outdoor  exercises . D. Whether  they enjoy  playing  with mirrors . 46. Why  does the author  mention  apes and dolphins  in the text? \u3000   \u3000 A. They  are most  familiar  to readers .   B. They  are big favorites  with zoo visitors . C.

I received  a letter  from  the head  of the Personnel  Department  that started , “Dear  John , I am quite  pleased  that you have  decided  to join us.” That “quite ” saddened  me. I thought  he was saying  “we’re kind of pleased  you decided  to join us although  I wish  we had hired  someone  else.” Then  I discovered  that in American  English  “quite ” sometimes  means  “very”, while  in British  English  it means  “fairly ”. So the first lesson  about  working  in other  countries  is to learn  the language  and by that I don’t just mean  the words  people  speak . It is body  language , dress , manners , ideas  and so on. The way people  do things  highlights  many  of the differences  we see between  cultures（文化） . Some  of these  differences  may be only on the surface  --- dress , food and hours  of work  --- while  others  may be deeper  and take longer  to deal with. Mostly , it is just a question  of getting  used to the differences  and accepting  them , like the climate（气候）, while  getting  on with business . Some  of the differences  may be an improvement . People  are more  polite ; the   service  is better ; you ask for something  to be done  and it happens  without  having  to ask again . However , other  differences  can be troubling , like punctuality （准时） . If you invite  people  to a party  at 7 o’clock  your guests  will consider  it polite  to turn up exactly  on time in Germany , five minutes  early  in the American  Midwest , an hour early  in Japan , 15 minutes  afterwards  in the UK, up to an hour afterwards  in Italy and some  time in the evening  in Greece . I prefer  not to use the word  “late” because  there  is nothing  wrong  with the times  people  arrive . It is simply  the accepted  thing  to do in their own country . 52.

His name  was Mr. Basille.  He wore  a white  cap and drove  a white  truck.  As a 5-year-old  boy, I couldn’t  take my eyes off the coin changer  fixed  to his belt. He noticed  this one day during  a delivery  and gave  me a quarter  out of his coin changer.  Of course,  he delivered  more  than milk.  There  was cheese,  eggs and so on. If we needed  to change  our order,  my mother  would  pen a note- --“Please  add a bottle  of buttermilk  next delivery”- --and place  it in the box along  with the empty  bottles.  And then,  the buttermilk  would  magically  appear.  All of this was about  more  than convenience.  There  existed  a close  relationship  between  families  and their milkmen.  Mr. Basille  even  had a key to out house,  for those  times  when  it was so cold outside  that we put the box indoors,  so that the milk wouldn’t  freeze.  And I remember  Mr. Basille  from  time to time taking  a break  at our kitchen  table,  having  a cup of tea and telling  stories  about  his delivery.  There  is sadly  no home  milk delivery  today.  Big companies  allowed  the production  of cheaper  milk,  thus making  it difficult  for milkmen  to compete.  Besides,  milk is for sale everywhere,  and it may just not have  been  practical  to have  a delivery  service.  Recently,  an old milk box in the countryside  I saw brought  back  my childhood  memories.  I took it home  and planted  it on the back  porch(门廊 ). Every  so often  my son’s  friends  will ask what  it is. So I start telling  stories  of my boyhood,  and of the milkman  who brought  us friendship  along  with his milk.  56. Mr. Basille  gave  the boy a quarter  out of his coin changer  _______.  A. to show  his magical  power       B. to pay for the delivery       C. to satisfy  his curiosity           D. to please  his mother  57. What  can be inferred  from  the fact that the milkman  had the key to the boy’s  house?  A. He wanted  to have  tea there.            B. He was a respectable  person.  C. He was treated  as a family  member.      D. He was fully  trusted  by the family.  58. Why  does home  milk delivery  no longer  exist?  A. Nobody  wants  to be a milkman  now.     B.

The Tall Persons  Club  Great  Britain  (TPCGB),  which  was formed  six months  ago to campaign  for the needs  of the tall, has turned  its attention  to hotels  and restaurants.  Beds  that are too small,  shower  heads  that are too low, and restaurant  tables  with hardly  any leg-room  all make  life difficult  for those  of above  average    height,  it says.  But it is not just the extra-tall  whose  needs  are not being  met. The average  night  of the population  has been  increasing  ye the standard  size of beds,  doorways,  and chairs  has remained  unchanged.  “The  bedding  industry  says a bed should  be six inches  larger  than the person  using  it, so even  a king-size  bed at 6′6″(6  feet and 6 inches)  is falling  short  for 25% of men,  while  the standard  6′3″ bed caters  for less than half of the male  population.”  said TPCGB  president  Phil Heinricy,  “seven-foot  beds would  work  fine.”  Similarly,  restaurant  tables  can cause  no end of problems.  Small  tables,  which  mean  the long-legged  have  to sit a foot or so away  from  them,  are enough  to make  tall customers  go elsewhere.  Some  have  already  taken  note,  however.  At Queens  Moat  Houses′  Caledonian  Hotel  in Edinburgh,  6′6″beds  are now put in as standard  after requests  for longer  beds from  taller  visitors,  particularly  Americans.  64. What  is the purpose  of the TPCGB  campaign?  A. To provide  better  services.             B. To rebuild  hotels  and restaurants.  C. To draw  public  attention  to the needs  of the tall.   D. To attract  more  people  to become  its members.  65. Which  of the following  might  be a bed of proper  length  according  to Phil Heinricy?  A . 7′2″        B. 7′        C. 6′6″        D. 6′3″ 66. What  may happen  to restaurants  with small  tables?  A. They  may lose some  customers.                B. They  may start businesses  elsewhere.  C. They  have  to find easy chairs  to match  the tables.   D. They  have  to provide  enough  space  for the long-legged.  67.

So this year she did something  more  than a hobby:  She planted  vegetables  in her yard.  For her fist garden,  Ms Feeley  has put in 15 tomato  plants,  and five rows  of a variety  of vegetables.  The family’s  old farm  house  has become  a chicken  house,  its residents  arriving  next month.  Last year,  Ms. Rita Gartin  kept a small  garden.  This year she has made  it much  larger  because,  she said, “The  cost of everything  is going  up and I was looking  to lose a few pounds  too; so it’s a win-win  situation  all around.”  They  are among  the growing  number  of Americans  who,  driven  by higher  living  costs  and a falling  economy  (经济 ), have  taken  up vegetable  gardening  for the first time.  Others  have  increased  the size of their existing  gardens.  Seed  companies  and garden  shops  say no since  the 1970s  have  there  been  such an increase  in interest  in growing  food at home.  Now  many  gardens  across  the country  have  been  sold out for several  months.  In Austin,  Tex, some  of the gardens  have  a three-year  waiting  list. George  C. Ball Jr, owner  of a company,  said sales  of vegetable  seeds  and plants  are up by 40%,  over last year,  double  the average  growth  of last five years.  Mr. Ball argues  that some  of the reasons  have  been  building  for the last few years.  The big one is striking  use in me cost on food like bread  and milk,  together  with the increases  in the price  of fruit and vegetables.  Food  prices  have  increase  of higher  oil price.  People  are driving  less, taking  fewer  vacations,  so there  more  time to garden.  68. What  does the word  “residents”  in Paragraph  1 probably  refer  to? A. chickens      B. tomatoes      C. gardens       D. people  69. By saying  “a win-win situation  all around ”, Ms. Gartin  means  that\u3000   \u3000. A. she is happier  and her garden  bigger  B. she may spend  less and lose weight  C. she is selling  more  and buying  less D. she has grown  more  varieties  of vegetables    70. Why  is vegetable  gardening  becoming  increasingly  popular?  A. More  Americans  are dong  it for fun.  B. The price  of oil is lower  than before.  C. There’s  a growing  need  for fruits.   D.

Most  people,  and many  animals,  like eating  it. However,  the only way for them  to get that honey  is to find a wild bees’ nest and take the honey  from  it. Often,  these  nests  are high up in trees,  and it is difficult  to find them.  In parts  of Africa,  though,  people  and animals  looking  for honey  have  a strange  and unexpected  helper  --- a little bird called  a honey  guide.  The honey  guide  does not actually  like honey,  but it does like the wax in the beehives  (蜂房 ). The little bird cannot  reach  this wax,  which  is deep  inside  the bees’ nest. So, when  it finds  a suitable  nest, it looks  for someone  to help it. The honey  guide  gives  a loud cry that attracts  the attention  of both passing  animals  and people.  Once  it has their attention,  it flies through  the forest,  waiting  from  time to time for the curious  animal  or person  as it leads  them  to the nest. When  they finally  arrive  at the nest, the follower  reaches  in to get at the delicious  honey  as the bird patiently  waits  and watches.  Some  of the honey,  and the wax,  always  falls to the ground,  and this is when  the honey  guide  takes  its share.  Scientists  do not know  why the honey  guide  likes  eating  the wax,  but it is very determined  in its efforts  to get it. The birds  seem  to be able to smell  wax from  a long distance  away.  They  will quickly  arrive  whenever  a beekeeper  is taking  honey  from  his beehives,  and will even  enter  churches  when  beeswax  candles  are being  lit. 60. Why  is it difficult  to find a wild bees’ nest?  A. It’s small  in size.        B. It’s hidden  in trees.  C. It’s covered  with wax.     D. It’s hard to recognize.  61. What  do the words  “the follower ” in Paragraph  2 refer  to? A. A bee.    B. A bird.    C. A honey  seeker.     D. A beekeeper.    62. The honey  guide  is special  in the way _______ .

Although  our “act” would  last only for a short  time,  we could  see quite  a number  of interesting  things.  We all stood  at the far end of the studio  as workmen  prepared  the scene,  setting  up trees  at the edge  of a winding  path.  Very  soon,  bright  lights  were  turned  on and the big movie-camera  was wheeled  into position.  The director  shouted  something  to the camera  operator  and then went  to speak  to the two famous  actors  nearby.  Since  it was hot in the studio,  it came  as a surprise  to us to see one of the actors  put on a heavy  overcoat  and start walking  along  the path.  A big fan began  blowing  tiny white  feathers  down  on him, and soon  the trees  were  covered  in “snow ”. Two more  fans were  turned  on, and a “strong  wind ” blew  through  the trees.  The picture  looked  so real that it made  us feel cold.  The next scene  was a complete  contrast  (对比 ). The way it was filmed  was quite  unusual.  Pictures  taken  on an island  in the Pacific  were  shown  on a glass  screen.  An actor  and actress  stood  in front  of the scene  so that they looked  as if they were  at the water ’s edge  on an island.  By a simple  trick like this, palm  trees,  sandy  beaches,  and blue,  clear  skies  had been  brought  into the studio!  Since  it was our turn next,  we were  left wondering  what  scene  would  be prepared  for us. For a full three  minutes  in our lives  we would  be experiencing  the excitement  of being  film “Stars ”! 64. Who  is the author?  A. A cameraman.                B. A film director.    C. A crowd-scene  actor.          D. A workman  for scene  setting.  65. What  made  the author  feel cold?  A. The heavy  snowfall.          B. The man-made  scene.  C. The low temperature.         D.

A man who has not had a chance  to go swimming  for years  can still swim  as well as ever when  he gets back  in the water.  He can get on a bicycle  after many  years  and still ride away.  He can play catch  and hit a ball as well as his son. A mother  who has not thought  about  the words  for years  can teach  her daughter  the poem  that begins  “Twinkle,  twinkle,  little star” or remember  the story  of Cinderella  or Goldilocks  and the Three  Bears.  One explanation  is the law of overlearning , which  can be stated  as follows:  Once  we have  learned  something,  additional  learning  trials  increase  the length  of time we will remember  it.                                 In childhood  we usually  continue  to practice  such skills  as swimming,  bicycle  riding,  and playing  baseball  long after we have  learned  them.  We continue  to listen  to and remind  ourselves  of words  such as “Twinkle,  twinkle,  little star” and childhood  tales such as Cinderella  and Goldilocks.  We not only learn  but overlearn.  The multiplication  tables  (乘法口诀表 ) are an exception  to the general  rule that we forget  rather  quickly  the things  that we learn  in school,  because  they are another  of the things  we overlearn  in childhood.  The law of overlearning  explains  why cramming  (突击学习 ) for an examination,  though  it may result  in a passing  grade,  is not a satisfactory  way to learn  a college  course.  By cramming,  a student  may learn  the subject  well enough  to get by on the examination,  but he is likely  soon  to forget  almost  everything  he learned.  A little   overlearning,  on the other  hand,  is really  necessary  for one’s future  development.  67. What  is the main  idea of Paragraph  1? A. People  remember  well what  they learned  in childhood.  B. Children  have  a better  memory  than grown-ups.  C. Poem  reading  is a good  way to learn  words.  D. Stories  for children  are easy to remember.  68. The author  explains  the law of overlearning  by _______.  A. presenting  research  findings    B. setting  down  general  rules  C. making  a comparison         D. using  examples  69. According  to the author,  being  able to use multiplication  tables  is _______.

They  don’t listen  because  they already  know  it all. I was lucky:  I became  a pilot in 1970,  almost  ten years  before  I graduated  from  medical  school.  I didn’t realize  then,  but becoming  a pilot makes  me a better  surgeon.  I loved  flying.  As I flew bigger,  faster  planes,  and in worse  weather.  I learned  about  crew  resource  management  (机组资源管理 ), or CRM,  a new idea to make  flying  safer.  It means  that crew  members  should  listen  and speak  up for a good  result,  regardless  of positions.  I first read about  CRM  in 1980.  Not long after that, an attending  doctor  and I were  flying  in bad weather.  The controller  had us turn too late to get our landing  ready.  The attending  doctor  was flying;  I was safety  pilot He was so busy  because  of the bad turn, he had forgotten  to put the landing  gear (起落架 ) down.  He was a better  pilot --- and my boss --- so it felt unusual  to speak  up. But I had to: Our lives  were  in danger.  I put aside  my uneasiness  and said, “We need  to put the landing  gear down  now! ” That was my first real lesson  in the power  of CRM,  and I’ve used it in the operating  room  ever since.  CRM  requires  that the pilot/surgeon  encourage  others  to speak  up. It further  requires  that when  opinions  are from  the opposite,  the doctor  doesn ’t overreact,  which  might  prevent  fellow  doctors  from  voicing  opinions  again.  So when  I’m in the operating  room,  I ask for ideas  and help from  others.  Sometimes  they’re not willing  to speak  up. But I hope  that if I continue  to encourage  them,  someday  someone  will keep  me from  “landing  gear up”. 56. What  dose the author  say about  doctors  in general?  A. They  like flying  by themselves.     B. They  are unwilling  to take advice.  C. They  pretend  to be good  pilots.     D. They  are quick  learners  of CRM.  57. The author  deepened  his understanding  of the power  of CRM  when_______.    A. he saved  the plane  by speaking  up    B. he was in charge  of a flying  task C. his boss landed  the plane  too late     D. his boss operated  on a patient  58. In the last paragraph  “landing  gear up” probably  means  ______.

The idea was to reunite  Europe  after the Second  World  War.  At the same  time,  the “Fringe”  appeared  as a challenge  to the official  festival.  Eight  theatre  groups  turned  up uninvited  in 1947,  in the belief  that everyone  should  have  the right  to perform,  and they did so in a public  house  disused  for years.  Soon,  groups  of studentsfirstly  from  Edinburgh  University,  and later from  the universities  of Oxford  and Cambridge,  Durham  and Birmingham  were  making  the journey  to the Scottish  capital  each summer  to perform  theatre  by little-known  writers  of plays  in small  church  halls  to the people  of Edinburgh.  Today  the “Fringe”,  once  less recognized,  has far outgrown  the festival  with around  1,500  performances  of theatre,  music  and dance  on every  one of the 21 days it lasts.  And yetas  early  as 1959,  with only 19 theatre  groups  performing,  some  said it was getting  too big. A paid administrator  was first employed  only in 1971,  and today  there  are eight  administrators  working  all year round  and the number  rises to 150 during  August  itself.  In 2004  there  were  200 places  housing  1,695  shows  by over 600 different  groups  from  50 different  countries.  More  than 1,25 million  tickets  were  sold.    60.

Looking  like a setting  from  the film Charlie  & the Chocolate  Factory , Singapore ’s Chocolate  Research  Facility  (CRF)  has over 100 varieties  of chocolates.  Its founder  is Chris  Lee who grew  up at his parents ’ corner  store  with one hand  almost  always  in the jar of sweets.  If the CRF  seems  to be a smart  idea,  that’s because  Lee is not merely  a seasoned  salesperson  but also head  of a marketing  department  that has business  relations  with big names  such as Levi’s and Sony.  That idea surely  results  in the imagination  at work  when  it comes  to making  different  flavored  (味道 ) chocolates.  The CRF ’s produce  is “green ”, made  within  the country  and divided  into 10 lines,  with the Alcohol  Series  being  the most  popular.  The Exotic  Series  --- with   Sichuan  pepper,  red bean  (豆), cheese  and other  flavors  --- also does well and is fun to taste.  And for chocolate  snobs , who think  that they have  a better  knowledge  of chocolate  than others,  the Connoisseur  Series  uses cocoa  beans  from  Togo,  Cuba,  Venezuela  , and Ghana,  among  others.  64. What  is good  about  chocolate?  A. It serves  as a suitable  gift.          B. It works  as an effective  medicine.  C. It helps  improve  the state of mind.    D. It strengthens  business  relations.  65. Why  is Chris  Lee able to develop  his idea of the CRF?  A. He knows  the importance  of research.  B. He learns  form  shops  of similar  types.  C.

And I am one of them.  Take  my family’s  last vacation.  It was my six-year-old  son’s  winter  break  form  school,  and we were  heading  home  form  Fort Lauderdale  after a weeklong  trip. The flight  was overbooked,  and Delta,  the airline,  offered  us $400  per person  in credits  to give up our seats  and leave  the next day. I had meeting  in New  York , So I had to get back.  But that didn’t mean  my husband  and my son couldn ’t stay. I took my nine-month-old  and took off for home.  The next day my husband  and son were  offered  more  credits  to take an even  later flight.  Yes, I encouraged  --- okay,  ordered-them  to wait it out at the airport,  to “earn” more  Delta  Dollars.  Our total take:  $1,600.  Not bad, huh? Now  some  people  may think  I’m a bad mother  and not such a great  wife either.  But as a big-time  bargain  hunter,  I know  the value  of a dollar.  And these  days,  a good  deal is something  few of us can afford  to pass up. I’ve made  living  looking  for the best deals  and exposing  (揭露 ) the worst  tricks.  I have  been  the consumer  reporter  of NBC ’s Today  show  for over a decade.  I have  written  a couple  of books  including  one titled  Tricks  of the Trade:  A Consumer  Survival  Guide.  And I really  do what  I believe  in. I tell you this because  there  is no shame  in getting  your money’s  worth.  I’m also tightfisted  when  it comes  to shoes,  clothes  for my children,  and expensive  restaurants.  But I wouldn ’t hesitate  to spend  on a good  haircut.  It keeps  its longer,  and it’s the first thing  people  notice.  And I will also spend  on a classic  piece  of furniture.  Quality  lasts.    56.

She is quiet  but alert (警觉 ). Twenty  centimeters  from  her face researchers  have  placed  a white  card with two black  spots  on it. She stares  at it carefully.  A researcher  removes  the card and replaces  it by another,  this time with the spots  differently  spaced.  As the cards  change  from  one to the other,  her gaze (凝视 ) starts  to lose its focus  --- until a third,  with three  black  spots,  is presented.  Her gaze returns;  she looks  at it for twice  as long as she did at the previous  card.  Can she tell that the number  two is different  from  three,  just 24 hours  after coming  into the world?  Or do newborns  simply  prefer  more  to fewer?  The same  experiment,  but with three  spots  shown  before  two, shows  the same  return  of interest  when  the number  of spots  changes.  Perhaps  it is just the newness?  When  slightly  older  babies  were  shown  cards  with pictures  of objects  (a comb,  a key, an orange  and so on), changing  the number  of objects  had an effect  separate  from  changing  the objects  themselves.  Could  it be the pattern  that two things  make,  as opposed  to three?  No again.  Babies  paid more  attention  to squares  moving  randomly  on a screen  when  their number  changed  from  two to three,  or three  to two. The effect  even  crosses  between  senses.  Babies    who were  repeatedly  shown  two spots  became  more  excited  when  they then heard  three  drumbeats  than when  they heard  just two; likewise  (同 样 地 ) when  the researchers  started  with drumbeats  and moved  to spots.  60.

I was telling  someone  how much  I had enjoyed  reading  Barack  Obama’s  Dreams  From  My Father  and how it had changed  my views  of our President.  A friend  I was talking  to agreed  with me that it was, in his words,  “a brilliantly （精彩地） written  book”.  however,  he then went  on to talk abour  Mr. Obama  in a way which  suggested  he had no idea of his background  at all. I sensed  that I was talking  to a book  liar. And it seems  that my friend  is not the only one. Approximately  two thirds  of people  have  lied about  reading  a book  which  they haven’t.  In the World  Book  Day’s  “Report  on Guilty  Secrets”,  Dreams  From  My Father  is at number  9. The report  lists ten books,  and various  authors,  which  people  have  lied about  reading,  and as I’m not one to lie too often  (I’d hate to be caught  out ), I’ll admit  here and now that I haven’t  read the entire  top ten. But I am pleased  to say that, unlike  42 percent  of peoplt,  I have    read the book  at number  one, George  Orwell’s  1984.  I think  it’s really  brilliant.  The World  Book  Day report  also has some  other  interesting  information  in it. It says that many  people  lie about  having  read jane Austen,  Charles  Dickens,  Fyodor  Dostoevsky  (I haven’t  read him, but haven’t  lied about  it either)and  Herman  Melville.  Asked  why they lied, the most  common  reason  was to “impress”  someone  they were  speaking  to. This coule  be tricky  if the conversation  became  more  in – depth!  But when  asked  which  authors  they actually  enjoy,  people  named  J.k. Rowling,  John  Grisham,  Sophie  Kinsella  (ah, the big sellers,  in other  words).  Forty-two  percent  of people  asked  admitted  they turned  to the back  of the book  to read the end before  finishing  the story  (I’ll come  clean:  I do this and am astonished  that 58 percent  said they had never  dome  so). 64. How  did the author  find his friend  a book  liar? A. By judging  his manner  of speaking.    B. By looking  into his background.  C. By mentioning  a famous  name.        D. By discussing  the book  it self. 65. Which  of the following  is a “guilty  secret”  according  to the World  Book  Day  report?  A. Charles  Dickens  is very low on the top-ten  list.  B. 42% of people  pretended  to have  read 1984.  C. The author  admitted  having  read 9 books.       D. Dreams  From  My Father  is hardly  read.  66. By lying  about  reading,  a person  hopes  to      . A. control  the conversation         B. appear  knowledgeable  C. learn  about  the book            D. make  more  friends  67. What  is the author’s  attitude  to 58% of readers?  A. Favorable      B. Uncaring       C. Doubtful       D.

Written  accounts  from  the 18th and 19th centuries  described  flocks（群） so large  that they darkened  the sky for hours.  It was calculated  that when  its population  reach  its highest  point,  there  were  more  than 3 billion  passenger  pigeons  – a number  equal  to 24 to 40 percent  of the total bird population  in the United  States,  making  it perhaps  the most  abundant  birds  in the world.  Even  as late as 1870  when  their numbers  had already  become  smaller,  a flock  believed  to be 1 mile wide  and 320 miles  (about  515 kilometers)  long was seen near Cincinnati.  Sadly,  the abundance  of passenger  pigeons  may have  been  their undoing . Where  the birds  were  abundant,  people  believed  there  was an ever-lasting  supply  and killed  them  by the thousands.  Commercial  hunters  attracted  them  to small  clearings  with grain,  waited  until pigeons  had settled  to feed,  then threw  large  nets over them,  taking  hundreds  at a time.  The birds  were  shipped  to large  cities  and sold in restaurants.  By the closing  decades  of the 19th century,  the hardwood  forests  where  passenger  pigeons  nested  had been  damaged  by Americans’  need  for wood,  which  scattered（驱散） the flocks  and forced  the birds  to go farther  north,  where  cold temperatures  and spring  storms  contributed  to their decline.  Soon  the great  flocks  were  gone,  never  to be seen again.  In 1897,  the state of Michigan  passed  a law prohibiting  the killing  of passenger  pigeons,  but by then,  no sizable  flocks  had been  seen in the state for 10 years.  The last confirmed  wild pigeon  in the United  States  was shot by a boy in Pike County,  Ohio,  in 1900.  For a time,  a few birds  survived  under  human  care.  The last of them,  known  affectionately  as Martha,  died at the Cincinnati  Zoological  Garden  in September  1, 1914.    24.

The whip  gets all of the attention , but it’s mostly  for show . In reality , it’s the chair  that does the important  work . When  a lion tamer  holds  a chair  in front  of the lion’s face, the lion tries to focus  on all four legs of the chair  at the same  time. With  its focus  divided , the lion becomes  confused  and is unsure  about  what  to do next. When  faced  with so many  options , the lion chooses  to freeze  and wait instead  of attacking  the man holding  the chair .     How  often  do you find yourself  in the same  position  as the lion? How  often  do you have  something  you want  to achieve（e.g. lose weight , start a business , travel  more）--- only to end up confused  by all of the options  in front  of you and never  make  progress ?     This upsets  me to no end because  while  all the experts  are busy  debating  about  which  option  is best, the people  who want  to improve  their lives  are left confused  by all of the conflicting  information . The end result  is that we feel like we can’t focus  or that we’re focused  on the wrong  things , and so we take less action , make  less progress ,   and stay the same  when  we could  be improving .     It doesn ’t have  to be that way. Anytime  you find the world  waving  a chair  in your face, remember  this: All you need  to do is focus  on one thing . You just need  to get started . Starting  before  you feel ready  is one of the habits  of successful  people . If you have  somewhere  you want  to go, something  you want  to accomplish , someone  you want  to become  … take immediate  action . If you’re clear  about  where  you want  to go, the rest of the world  will either  help you get there  or get out of the way. 28. Why  does the lion tamer  use a chair ? \u3000   \u3000 A. To show  off his skills .       B. To trick the lion. C. To get ready  for a fight .      D. To entertain  the audience . 29. In what  sense  are people  similar  to a lion facing  a chair ? \u3000   \u3000 A. They  feel puzzled  over choices .     B. They  hold on to the wrong  things . C. They  find it hard to make  changed .   D. They  have  to do something  for show . 30. What  is the author ’s attitude  towards  the experts  mentioned  in Paragraph  3? \u3000   \u3000 A. Tolerant        B. Doubtful       C. Respectful       D. Supportive  31. When  the world  is “waving  a chair  in your face”, you’re advised  to\u3000   \u3000. A. wait for a better  chance      B. break  your old habits  C. make  a quick  decision       D. ask for clear  guidance<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, best_of=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=-1, min_p=0.0, seed=None, use_beam_search=False, length_penalty=1.0, early_stopping=False, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=512, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None), prompt_token_ids: [151644, 8948, 198, 2610, 525, 264, 10950, 17847, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 872, 198, 56568, 101909, 22574, 101057, 3837, 100638, 31838, 89012, 106367, 14582, 25, 356, 362, 14260, 220, 39032, 259, 15232, 9909, 116819, 101336, 99235, 220, 7552, 258, 1251, 17744, 82, 3971, 220, 374, 458, 22887, 1743, 220, 9963, 220, 264, 50076, 220, 42344, 111241, 7552, 323, 264, 10496, 659, 576, 50076, 220, 5221, 678, 315, 279, 6529, 1154, 714, 432, 748, 10008, 220, 369, 1473, 659, 758, 8729, 1154, 432, 748, 279, 10496, 220, 429, 1558, 279, 2989, 220, 975, 659, 3197, 220, 264, 39032, 259, 15232, 220, 9982, 220, 264, 10496, 220, 304, 4065, 220, 315, 279, 39032, 748, 3579, 11, 279, 39032, 16297, 311, 5244, 220, 389, 678, 3040, 14201, 315, 279, 10496, 220, 518, 279, 1852, 220, 882, 13, 3085, 220, 1181, 5244, 220, 17779, 1154, 279, 39032, 9044, 220, 21815, 220, 323, 374, 42903, 220, 911, 220, 1128, 220, 311, 653, 1790, 13, 3197, 220, 16601, 220, 448, 773, 1657, 220, 2606, 1154, 279, 39032, 39911, 220, 311, 29930, 220, 323, 3783, 4518, 220, 315, 22818, 220, 279, 883, 9963, 220, 279, 10496, 659, 257, 2585, 220, 3545, 220, 653, 498, 1477, 6133, 220, 304, 279, 1852, 220, 2309, 220, 438, 279, 39032, 30, 2585, 220, 3545, 220, 653, 498, 614, 220, 2494, 220, 498, 1366, 220, 311, 11075, 9909, 68, 1302, 13, 9052, 4680, 1154, 1191, 264, 2562, 1154, 5821, 220, 803, 7552, 4421, 1172, 311, 835, 705, 21815, 220, 553, 678, 315, 279, 2606, 220, 304, 4065, 220, 315, 498, 323, 2581, 220, 1281, 220, 5098, 937, 257, 1096, 705, 4917, 220, 752, 311, 902, 835, 1576, 220, 1393, 220, 678, 279, 11647, 220, 525, 13028, 220, 70413, 220, 911, 220, 892, 220, 2999, 220, 374, 1850, 11, 279, 1251, 220, 879, 1366, 220, 311, 7269, 220, 862, 6305, 220, 525, 2115, 21815, 220, 553, 678, 315, 279, 51033, 220, 1995, 659, 576, 835, 1102, 220, 374, 429, 582, 2666, 1075, 582, 646, 1405, 5244, 220, 476, 429, 582, 3129, 10735, 220, 389, 279, 4969, 220, 2513, 1154, 323, 773, 582, 1896, 2686, 1917, 1154, 1281, 220, 2686, 5098, 1154, 256, 323, 4717, 279, 1852, 220, 979, 220, 582, 1410, 220, 387, 18392, 659, 257, 1084, 3171, 17744, 83, 614, 220, 311, 387, 429, 1616, 13, 5765, 1678, 220, 498, 1477, 279, 1879, 220, 63111, 220, 264, 10496, 220, 304, 697, 3579, 11, 6099, 220, 419, 25, 2009, 498, 1184, 220, 311, 653, 374, 5244, 220, 389, 825, 3166, 659, 1446, 1101, 1184, 220, 311, 633, 3855, 659, 27657, 220, 1573, 220, 498, 2666, 5527, 220, 374, 825, 315, 279, 25785, 220, 315, 6849, 220, 1251, 659, 1416, 498, 614, 220, 14696, 220, 498, 1366, 220, 311, 728, 11, 2494, 220, 498, 1366, 220, 311, 22054, 1154, 4325, 220, 498, 1366, 220, 311, 3635, 220, 4593, 1896, 13922, 220, 1917, 659, 1416, 498, 3129, 2797, 220, 911, 220, 1380, 220, 498, 1366, 220, 311, 728, 11, 279, 2732, 315, 279, 1879, 220, 686, 2987, 220, 1492, 498, 633, 1052, 220, 476, 633, 700, 315, 279, 1616, 13, 220, 17, 23, 13, 8429, 220, 1558, 279, 39032, 259, 15232, 220, 990, 264, 10496, 937, 220, 22441, 262, 22441, 362, 13, 2014, 1473, 220, 1007, 806, 7361, 659, 981, 425, 13, 2014, 14068, 279, 39032, 13, 356, 13, 2014, 633, 5527, 220, 369, 264, 4367, 659, 414, 422, 13, 2014, 45176, 220, 279, 10650, 659, 220, 17, 24, 13, 758, 1128, 220, 5530, 220, 525, 1251, 220, 4428, 220, 311, 264, 39032, 12880, 220, 264, 10496, 937, 220, 22441, 262, 22441, 362, 13, 2379, 220, 2666, 86320, 220, 916, 11454, 659, 257, 425, 13, 2379, 220, 3331, 389, 311, 279, 4969, 220, 2513, 659, 356, 13, 2379, 220, 1477, 432, 2588, 311, 1281, 220, 5497, 659, 256, 422, 13, 2379, 220, 614, 220, 311, 653, 2494, 220, 369, 1473, 659, 220, 18, 15, 13, 3555, 220, 374, 279, 3150, 17744, 82, 18915, 220, 6974, 220, 279, 11647, 220, 9733, 220, 304, 49351, 220, 220, 18, 30, 220, 22441, 262, 22441, 362, 13, 350, 22072, 517, 286, 425, 13, 54864, 83, 1262, 981, 356, 13, 77038, 1262, 981, 422, 13, 9186, 533, 220, 220, 18, 16, 13, 3197, 220, 279, 1879, 220, 374, 1036, 86, 2317, 220, 264, 10496, 220, 304, 697, 3579, 9336, 498, 3129, 25104, 220, 311, 22441, 262, 22441, 13, 362, 13, 3783, 369, 264, 2664, 220, 6012, 414, 425, 13, 1438, 220, 697, 2310, 25785, 220, 356, 13, 1281, 220, 264, 3974, 220, 5480, 981, 422, 13, 2548, 369, 2797, 220, 18821, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198], lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

In fact, half of the 6,000-7,000  languages  spoken  around  the world  today  will likely  die out by the next century,  according  to the United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific,  and Cultural  Organization  (UNESCO).   In an effort  to prevent  language  loss, scholars  from  a number  of organizations- -- UNESCO  and National  Geographic  among  them ---have  for many  years  been  documenting  dying  languages  and the cultures  they reflect.  Mark  Turin,  a scientist  at the Macmillan  Center,  Yale  University,  who specializes  in the languages  and oral traditions  of the Himalayas,  is following  in that   tradition . His recently  published  book,  A Grammar  of Thangmi  with an Ethnolinguistic  Introduction  to the Speakers  and Their  Culture , grows  out of his experience  living,  looking  and raising  a family  in a village  in Nepal.  Documenting  the Tangmi  language  and culture  is just a starting  point  for Turin,  who seeks  to include  other  languages  and oral traditions  across  the Himalayans  reaches  of India,  Nepal,  Bhutan,  and China.  But he is not content  to simply  record  these  voices  before  they disappear  without  record.  At the University  of Cambridge  Turin  discovered  a wealth  of important  materials ---including  photographs,  films,  tap recordings,  and field notes- --which  had remained  unstudied  and were  badly  in need  of care and protection.  Now,  through  the two organizations  that he has founded- --the Digital  Himalaya  Project  and the World  Oral Literature  Project- --Turin  has started  a campaign  to make  such documents,  found  in libraries  and stores  around  the world,  available  not just to scholars  but to the youngers.  Generations  of communities  from  whom  the materials  were  originally  collected.  Thanks  to digital  technology  and the widely  available  Internet.

But what  began  as nothing  important  in public  affairs  has grown  into a social  movement.  Business  people,  political  leaders,  university  professors,  and especially  millions  of grass-roots  Americans  are taking  part in the movement.  “The  understanding  has increased  many,  many  times,”  says Gaylord  Nelson,  the former   governor  from  Wisconsin,  who thought  up the first According  to US government  reports,  emissions  (排放 ) from  cars and trucks  have  dropped  from  10.3 million  tons a year to 5.5 tons.  The number  of cities  producing  CO beyond  the standard  has been  reduced  from  40 to 9. Although  serious  problems  still remain  and need  to be dealt  with,  the world  is a safer  and healthier  place.  A kind of “Green  thinking”  has become  part of practices.  Great  improvement  has been  achieved.  In 1988  there  were  only 600 recycling  programs;  today  in 1995  there  are about  6,600.  Advanced  lights,  motors,  and building  designs  have  helped  save a lot of energy  and therefore  prevented  pollution.  Twenty -five years  ago, there  were  hardly  any education  programs  for environment.  Today,  it’s hard to find a public  school,  university,  or law school  that   does not have  such a kind of program.”  Until  we do that, nothing  else will change!”  say Bruce  Anderson.  25.

Au Pair in Stamford,  for example,  has got increasing  numbers  of request  for Chinese  au pairs  from  aero to around  4,000  since  2004.  And that’s  true all across  the country.  “I thought  it would  be useful  for him to learn  Chinese  at an early  age” Joseph  Stocke,  the managing  director  of s company,  says of his 2-year -old son. “I would  at least like to give him the chance  to use the language  in the future .” After  only six months  of being  cared  by 25-year-old  woman  from  China,  the boy can already  understand  basic  Chinese  daily  expressions,  his dad says.  Li Drake,  a Chinese  native  raising  two children  in Minnesota  with an American  husband,  had another  reason  for looking  for an au pair from  China.  She didn’t  want  her children  to miss out on their roots.  “Because  I am Chinese,  my husband  and I   wanted  the children  to keep  exposed  to (接触 ) the language  and culture.”  she says.  “Staying  with a native  speaker  is better  for children  than simply  sitting  in a classroom,”  says Suzanne  Flynn,  a professor  in language  education  of Children.  “But parents  must  understand  that just one year with au pair is unlikely  to produce  wonders.   Complete  mastery  demands  continued  learning  until the age of 10 or 12.” The popularity  if au pairs  from  China  has been  strengthened  by the increasing  numbers  of American  parents  who want  their children  who want  their children  to learn  Chinese.  It is expected  that American  demand  for au pairs  will continue  to rise in the next few years.  29. What  does that term “au pair” in the text mean ? \u3000   \u3000 A.

I left for the land of warmth  and vitamin  C (维生素C), thinking  of beaches  and orange  trees.  When  we touched  down  to blue skies  and warm  air, I sent up a small  prayer  of gratefulness.  Swimming  pools,  wine  tasting,  and pink sunsets  (at normal  evening  hours,  not 4 in the afternoon)  filled  the weekend,  but the best part — particularly  to my taste,  dulled  by months  of cold — weather  root vegetables  — was a 7 a.m. adventure  to the Sarasota  farmers’  market  that proved  to be more  than worth  the early  wake-up  call. The market,  which  was founded  in 1979,  sets up its tents  every  Saturday  from  7 a.m. to 1 p.m.,  rain or shine,  along  North  Lemon  and State  streets.  Baskets  of perfect    red strawberries,  the red-painted  sides  of the Java Dawg  coffee  truck;  and most  of all, the tomatoes:  amazing,  large,  soft and round  red tomatoes.  Disappointed  by many  a broken,  vine-ripened  (蔓上成熟的 ) promise,  I’ve refused  to buy winter  tomatoes  for years.  No matter  how attractive  they look in the store,  once  I get them  home  they’re  unfailingly  dry, hard,  and tasteless.  But I homed  in, with uncertainty,  on one particular  table  at the Brown’s  Grove  Farm’s  stand,  full of fresh  and soft tomatoes  the size of my fist. These  were  the real deal — and at that moment,  I realized  that the best part of Sarasota  in winter  was going  to be eating  things  that back  home  in New  York  I wouldn’t  be experiencing  again  for months.  Delighted  as I was by the tomatoes  in sight,  my happiness  deepened  when  I learned  that Brown’s  Grove  Farm  is one of the suppliers  for Jack Dusty,  a newly  opened  restaurant  at the Sarasota  Ritz Carlton,  where  — luckily  for me — I was planning  to have  dinner  that very night.  Without  even  seeing  the menu,  I knew  I’d be ordering  every  tomato  on it. 24. What  did the author  think  of her winter  life in New  York?  A. Exciting.     B. Boring.       C. Relaxing.       D. Annoying.  25. What  made  the author’s  getting  up early  worthwhile?  A. Having  a swim.   B. Breathing  in fresh  air.  C. Walking  in the morning  sun. D. Visiting  a local  farmer’s  market.  26. What  can we learn  about  tomatoes  sold in New  York  in winter?  A. They  are soft.  B. They  look nice.   C. They  taste great.  D. They  are juicy.  27. What  was the author  going  to do that evening?  A. Go to a farm.    B. Check  into a hotel.   C. Eat in a restaurant.   D. Buy fresh  vegetables.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, best_of=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0,

This evening,  as on every    Thursday  night,  psychologist  Maud  Lehanne  is leading  two of France’s  favorite  pastimes,  coffee  drinking  and the “talking  cure”. Here  they are learning  to get in touch  with their true feelings.  It isn’t always  easy.  The customers  — some  thirty  Parisians  who pay just under  $2 (plus  drinks)  per session  — care quick  to intellectualize  (高谈阔论 ), slow  to open  up and connect.  “You are forbidden  to say ‘one feels’  or ‘people  think’ ” Lehanne  told them.  “Say ‘I think,’  ‘Think  me’.”  A café society  where  no intellectualizing  is allowed?  It couldn’t  seem  more  un-French.  But Lehanne’s  psychology  café is about  more  than knowing  oneself:  It’s trying  to help the city’s  troubled  neighborhood  cafes.  Over  the years,  Parisian  cafes  have  fallen  victim  to changes  in the French  lifestyle  — longer  working  hours,  a fast food boom  and a younger  generation’s  desire  to spend  more  time at home.  Dozens  of new theme  cafes  appear  to change  the situation.  Cafes  focused  around  psychology,  history,  and engineering  are catching  on, filling  tables  well into the evening.  The city’s  “psychology  cafes ”, which  offer  great  comfort,  are among  the most  popular  places.  Middle-aged  homemakers,  retirees,  and the unemployed  come  to such cafes  to talk about  love,  anger,  and dreams  with a psychologist.  And they come  to Lehanne’s  group  just to learn  to say what  they feel. “There’s  a strong  need  in Paris  for communication, ” says Maurice  Frisch,  a café La Chope  regular  who works  as a religious  instructor  in a nearby  church.  “People  have  few real friends.  And they need  to open  up”. Lehanne  says she’d  like to see psychology  cafes  all over France.  “If people  had normal  lives,  these  cafes  wouldn’t  exist, ” she says.  “If life weren’t  a battle,  people  wouldn’t  need  a special  place  just to speak. ” But then,  it wouldn’t  be France.    32. What  are people  encouraged  to do at the cafe La Chope?   A. Learn  a new subject.    B. Keep  in touch  with friends.   C. Show  off their knowledge.   D. Express  their true feelings.   33. How  are cafes  affected  by French  lifestyle  changes?   A. They  are less frequently  visited.   B. They  stay open  for longer  hours.   C. They  have  bigger  night  crowds.   D. They  start to serve  fast food.   34. What  are theme  cafes  expected  to do?  A. Create  more  jobs.    B. Supply  better  drinks.     C. Save  the cafe business.   D. Serve  the neighborhood.   35. Why  are psychology  cafes  becoming  popular  in Paris?   A. They  bring  people  true friendship.    B. They  give people  spiritual  support.   C. They  help people  realize  their dreams.   D. They  offer  a platform  for business  links.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, best_of=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0,

I was able to buy it a little over a year ago because  I had my relatives  give me money  for my birthday  instead  of a lot of clothes  that wouldn’t  fit. I let a salesclerk  fool me into buying  a discontinued  model.  I realized  this a day late, when  I saw newspaper  advertisements  for the set at seventy-five  dollars  less than I had paid.  The set worked  so beautifully  when  I first got it home  that I would  keep  it on until stations  signed  off for the night.  Fortunately,  I didn’t  got any channels  showing  all-night  movies  or I would  never  have  gotten  to bed. Then  I started  developing  a problem  with the set that involved  static  (静电 ) noise.  For some  reason,  when  certain  shows  switched  into a commercial,  a loud noise  would  sound  for a few seconds.  Gradually,  this noise  began  to appear  during  a show,  and to get rid of it, I had to change  to another  channel  and then change  it back.  Sometimes  this technique  would  not work,  and I had to pick up the set and shake  it to remove  the sound.  I actually  began  to build  up my arm muscles  (肌肉 ) shaking  my set. When  neither  of these  methods  removed  the static  noise,  I would  sit helplessly  and wait for the noise  to go away.  At last I ended  up hitting  the set with my fist, and it stopped  working  altogether.  My trip to the repair  shop  cost me $62, and the set is working  well now,  but I keep  expecting  more  trouble.  21. Why  did the author  say he was fooled  into buying  the TV set? A. He got an older  model  than he had expected.  B. He couldn’t  return  it when  it was broken.  C. He could  have  bought  it at a lower  price.    D. He failed  to find any movie  shows  on it. 22. Which  of the following  can best replace  the phrase  “signed  off” in Paragraph  1? A. ended  all their programs .       B. provided  fewer  channels . C. changed  to commercials .       D. showed  all-night  movies . 23. How  did the author  finally  get his TV set working  again?  A. By shaking  and hitting  it.      B. By turning  it on and off. C. By switching  channels.         D. By having  it repaired.  24. How  does the another  sound  when  telling  the story  ? A. Curious       B. Anxious        C. Cautious        D.

Experts  say the way you design  your home  could  play a role in whether  you pack  on the pounds  or keep  them  off. You can make  your environment  work  for you instead  of against  you. Here  are some  ways  to turn your home  into part of diet plan.  Open  the curtains  and turn up the lights.  Dark  environments  are more  likely  to encourage  overeating,  for people  are often  less self-conscious （难为情） when  they’re  in poorly  lit places-and  so more  likely  to eat lots of food.  If your home  doesn’t  have  enough  window  light,  get more  lamps  and flood  the place  with brightness.  Mind  the colors.  Research  suggests  warm  colors  fuel our appetites.  In one study,  people  who ate meals  in a blue room  consumed  33 percent  less than those  in a yellow  or red room.  Warm  colors  like yellow  make  food appear  more  appetizing,  while  cold colors  make  us feel less hungry.  So when  it’s time to repaint,  go blue.  Don’t  forget  the clock—or the radio.  People  who eat slowly  tend to consume  about  70 fewer  calories（卡路里） per meal  than those  who rush through  their meals.  Begin  keeping  track  of the time,  and try to make  dinner  last at least 30 minutes,  And while  you’re  at it, actually  sit down  to eat. If you need  some  help slowing  down,  turn on relaxing  music.  It makes  you less likely  to rush through  a meal.  Downsize  the dishes,  Big serving  bowls  and plates  can easily  make  us fat. We eat about  22 percent  more  when  using  a 12-inch  plate  instead  of a 10-inch  plate.    When  we choose  a large  spoon  over a smaller  one ,total  intake（摄入）  jumps  by 14 percent.  And we’ll  pour about  30 percent  more  liquid  into a short,  wide  glass  than a tall, skinny  glass.  25. The text is especially  helpful  for those  who care about_______.

It used to be called  the “year  off” between  school  and university.  The gap-year  phenomenon  originated  (起源 ) with the months  left over to Oxbridge  applicants  between  entrance  exams  in November  and the start of the next academic  year.  This year,  25,310  students  who have  accepted  places  in higher  education  institutions  have  put off their entry  until next year,  according  to statistics  on university  entrance  provided  by University  and College  Admissions  Service  (UCAS).  That is a record  14.7%  increase  in the number  of students  taking  a gap year.  Tony  Higgins  from  UCAS  said that the statistics  are good  news  for everyone  in higher  education.  “Students  who take a well-planned  year out are more  likely  to be satisfied  with,  and complete,  their chosen  course.  Students  who take a gap year are often  more  mature  and responsible,”  he said.   But not everyone  is happy.  Owain  James,  the president  of the National  Union  of Students  (NUS),  argued  that the increase  is evidence  of student  had ship — young  people  are being  forced  into earning  money  before  finishing  their education.  “New  students  are now aware  that they are likely  to leave  university  up to ￡15,000  in debt.  It is not surprising  that more  and more  students  are taking  a gap year to earn money  to support  their study  for the degree.  NUS  statistics  show  that over 40% of students  are  forced  to work  during  term time and the figure  increases  to 90% during  vacation  periods,”  he said. 29. What  do we learn  about  the gap year from  the text?  A. It is flexible  in length.        B. It is a time for relaxation.  C. It is increasingly  popular.     D. It is required  by universities.  30. According  to Tony  Higgins,  students  taking  a gap year______.  A. are better  prepared  for college  studies  B. know  a lot more  about  their future  jobs C. are more  likely  to leave  university  in debt D. have  a better  chance  to enter  top universities  31. How  does Owain  James  feel about  the gap-year  phenomenon?  A. He’s puzzled.   B. He’s worried.   C. He’s surprised.   D. He’s annoyed.  32.

Of the outstanding  ladies  listed  below,  who do you think  was the most  important  woman  of the past 100 years?   Jane  Addams  (1860-1935)  Anyone  who has ever been  helped  by a social  worker  has Jane Addams  to thank.  Addams  helped  the poor and worked  for peace.  She encouraged  a sense  of community  (社区 ) by creating  shelters  and promoting  education  and services  for people  in need.  In 1931,  Addams  became  the first American  woman  to win the Nobel  Peace  Prize.   Rachel  Carson  (1907-1964)  If it weren’t  for Rachel  Carson,  the environmental  movement  might  not exist  today.  Her popular  1962  book  Silent  Spring  raised  awareness  of the dangers  of pollution  and the harmful  effects  of chemicals  on humans  and on the world’s  lakes  and oceans.   Sandra  Day O’Connor  (1930-present)  When  Sandra  Day O’Connor  finished  third  in her class  at Stanford  Law School,  in 1952,  she could  not find work  at a law firm because  she was a woman.  She became  an Arizona  state senator  (参议员 ) and, in 1981,  the first woman  to join the U.S. Supreme  Court.  O’Connor  gave  the deciding  vote in many  important  cases  during  her 24 years  on the top court.     Rosa  Parks  (1913-2005)  On December  1, 1955,  in Montgomery,  Alabama,  Rasa  Parks  would  not give up her seat on a bus to a passenger.  Her simple  act landed  Parks  in prison.  But it also set off the Montgomery  bus boycott.  It lasted  for more  than a year,  and kicked  off the civil-rights  movement.  “The  only tired I was, was tired of giving  in,” said Parks.  21. What  is Jane Addams  noted  for in history?  A. Her social  work.            B. Her teaching  skills.  C. Her efforts  to win a prize.     D. Her community  background.  22. What  was the reason  for O’Connor’s  being  rejected  by the law firm?  A. Her lack of proper  training  in law. B. Her little work  experience  in court.  C. The discrimination  against  women.  D.

Even  when  her daughter  and son asked  her to move  to San Antonio  to help with their children,  she politely  refused.  Only  after a year of friendly  discussion  did Ms. Garza  finally  say yes. That was four years  ago. Today  all three  generations  regard  the move  as a success,  giving  them  a closer  relationship  than they would  have  had in separate  cities.  No statistics  show  the number  of grandparents  like Garza  who are moving  closer  to adult  children  and grandchildren.  Yet there  is evidence  suggesting  that the trend  is   growing.  Even  President  Obama’s  mother-in-law,  Marian  Robinson,  has agreed  to leave  Chicago  and move  into the White  House  to help care for her granddaughters.  According  to a study  by grandparents.com,  83 percent  of the people  said Mrs. Robinson’s  decision  will influence  grandparents  in the American  family.  Two-thirds  believe  more  families  will follow  the example  of Obama’s  family.  “In the 1960s  we were  all a little wild and couldn’t  get away  from  home  far enough  or fast enough  to prove  we could  do it on our own,”  says Christine  Crosby,  publisher  of Grand , a magazine  for grandparents.  “We now realize  how important  family  is and how important  it is to be near them,  especially  when  you’re  raising  children.”  Moving  is not for everyone.  Almost  every  grandparent  wants  to be with his or her grandchildren  and is willing  to make  sacrifices,  but sometimes  it is wiser  to say no and visit frequently  instead.  Having  your grandchildren  far away  is hard,  especially  knowing  your adult  child  is struggling,  but giving  up the life you know  may be harder.  25. Why  was Garza’s  move  a success?  A. It strengthened  her family  ties. B. It improved  her living  conditions.  C. It enabled  her make  more  friends.  D. It helped  her know  more  new places.  26. What  was the reaction  of the public  to Mrs. Robinson’s  decision?  A. 17% expressed  their support  for it. B. Few people  responded  sympathetically.  C. 83% believed  it had a bad influence.  D. The majority  thought  it was a trend.  27. What  did Crosby  say about  people  in the 1960s?  A. They  were  unsure  of themselves.  B. They  were  eager  to raise  more  children.  C.

Since  March  2012,  I’ve done  89 trips — of those  , 51 have  been  abroad,  I have  42 hours  to carry  stem  cells (干细胞 ) in my little box because  I’ve got two ice packs  and that’s  how long they last. In all, from  the time the stem  cells are harvested  from  a donor  (捐献者 ) to the time they can be implanted  in the patient,  we’ve  got 72 hours  at most,  So I am always  conscious  of time.  I had one trip last year where  I was caught  by a hurricane  in America.  I picked  up the stem  cells in Providence,  Rhode  Island,  and was meant  to fly to Washington  then back  to London.  But when  I arrived  at the check-in  desk at Providence,  the lady on the desk said:  “Well,  I’m really  sorry,  I’ve got some  bad news  for you — there  are no flights  from  Washington.”  So I took my box and put it on the desk and I said:  “In this box are some  stem  cells that are urgently  needed  for a patient  — please,  please,  you’ve  got to get me back  to the United  Kingdom.”  She just dropped  everything.  She arranged  for a flight  on a small  plane  to be held for me. re-routed  (改道 ) me through  Newark  and got me back  to the UK even  earlier  than originally  scheduled.  For this courier  job, you’re  consciously  aware  that in that box you’ve  got something  that is potentially  going  to save somebody’s  life. 29.

Silences  may be thoughtful,  or they may be empty  when  a person  has nothing  to say. A silence  in a conversation  may also show  stubbornness,  uneasiness,  or worry.  Silence  may be viewed  by some  cultural  groups  as extremely  uncomfortable;  therefore  attempts  may be made  to fill every  gap (间隙 ) with conversation.  Persons  in other  cultural  groups  value  silence  and view  it as necessary  for understanding  a person’s  needs.   Many  Native  Americans  value  silence  and feel it is a basic  part of communicating  among  people,  just as some  traditional  Chinese  and Thai persons  do. Therefore,  when  a person  from  one of these  cultures  is speaking  and suddenly  stops,  what  maybe  implied  (暗示 ) is that the person  wants  the listener  to consider  what  has been  said before  continuing.  In these  cultures,  silence  is a call for reflection.  Other  cultures  may use silence  in other  ways,  particularly  when  dealing  with conflicts  among  people  or in relationships  of people  with different  amounts  of power.  For example,  Russian,  French,  and Spanish  persons  may use silence  to show  agreement  between  parties  about  the topic  under  discussion.  However,  Mexicans  may use silence  when  instructions  are given  by a person  in authority  rather  than be rude to that person  by arguing  with him or her. In still another  use, persons  in Asian  cultures  may view  silence  as a sign of respect,  particularly  to an elder  or a person  in authority.  Nurses  and other  care-givers  need  to be aware  of the possible  meanings  of silence  when  they come  across  the personal  anxiety  their patients  may be experiencing.  Nurses  should  recognize  their own personal  and cultural  construction  of silence  so that a patient’s  silence  is not interrupted  too early  or allowed  to go on unnecessarily.  A nurse  who understands  the healing  (治愈 ) value  of silence  can use this understanding  to assist  in the care of patients  from  their own and from  other    cultures.  32. What  does the author  say about  silence  in conversations?  A. It implies  anger.              B. It promotes  friendship.  C. It is culture-specific.           D. It is content-based.  33. Which  of the following  people  might  regard  silence  as a call for careful  thought?  A. The Chinese.     B. The French.     C. The Mexicans.    D. The Russians.  34.

I put a small  set of Tinkertoys  in front  of each student,  and said:  “Make  something  out of the Tinkertoys.  You have  45 minutes  today  ― and 45 minutes  each day for the rest of the week.”  A few students  hesitated  to start.  They  waited  to see what  the rest of the class  would  do. Several  others  checked  the instructions  and made  something  according  to one of the model  plans  provided.  Another  group  built something  out of their own imaginations.    Once  I had a boy who worked  experimentally  with Tinkertoys  in his free time.  His constructions  filled  a shelf  in the art classroom  and a good  part of his bedroom  at home.  I was delighted  at the presence  of such a student.  Here  was an exceptionally  creative  mind  at work.  His presence  meant  that I had an unexpected  teaching  assistant  in class  whose  creativity  would  infect  (感染 ) other  students.  Encouraging  this kind of thinking  has a downside . I ran the risk of losing  those  students  who had a different  style  of thinking.  Without  fail one would  declare,  “But  I’m just not creative.”  “Do you dream  at night  when  you’re  asleep?”  “Oh,  sure.”  “So tell me one of your most  interesting  dreams.”  The student  would  tell something  wildly  imaginative.  Flying  in the sky or in a time machine  or growing  three  heads.  “That’s  pretty  creative.  Who  does that for you?”  “Nobody.  I do it.” “Really  ― at night,  when  you’re  asleep?”  “Sure.”  “Try  doing  it in the daytime,  in class,  okay?”  25. The teacher  used Tinkertoys  in class  in order  to ________?  A. know  more  about  the students     B. make  the lessons  more  exciting  C. raise  the students’  interest  in art   D. teach  the students  about  toy design  26. What  do we know  about  the boy mentioned  in Paragraph  3? A. He liked  to help his teacher.      B. He preferred  to study  alone.  C. He was active  in class.           D. He was imaginative.  27. What  does the underlined  word  “downside”  in Paragraph  4 probably  mean?  A. Mistake.     B. Drawback.       C. Difficulty.      D. Burden.  28.

Think  of the people  who belong  to book  groups.  They  choose  books  to read and then meet  to discuss  them.  Now,  the website  BookCrossing.com  turns  the page  on the traditional  idea of a book  group.  Members  go on the site and register  the books  they own and would  like to share.  BookCrossing  provides  an identification  number  to stick  inside  the book.  Then  the person  leaves  it in a public  place,  hoping  that the book  will have  an adventure,  traveling  far and wide  with each new reader  who finds  it. Bruce  Pederson,  the managing  director  of BookCrossing,  says,  “The  two things  that change  your life are the people  you meet  and books  you read.  BookCrossing  combines  both.”  Members  leave  books  on park benches  and buses,  in train stations  and coffee  shops.  Whoever  finds  their book  will go to the site and record  where  they found  it. People  who find a book  can also leave  a journal  entry  describing  what  they thought  of it. E-mails  are then sent to the BookCrossing  to keep  them  updated  about  where  their books  have  been  found.  Bruce  Peterson  says the idea is for people  not to be selfish  by keeping  a book  to gather  dust on a shelf  at home.  BookCrossing  is part of a trend  among  people  who want  to get back  to the “real”  and not the virtual  (虚拟 ). The site now has more  than one million  members  in more  than one hundred  thirty-five  countries.  29. Why  does the author  mention  book  groups  in the first paragraph?  A.

Frank  Hurley’s  pictures  would  be outstanding  ― undoubtedly  first-rate  photo-journalism  ― if they had been  made  last week.  In fact, they were  shot from  1914  through  1916,  most  of them  after a disastrous  shipwreck  (海 难 ), by a cameraman  who had no reasonable  expectation  of survival.  Many  of the images  were  stored  in an ice chest,  under  freezing  water,  in the damaged  wooden  ship.  The ship was the Endurance , a small,  tight,  Norwegian-built  three-master  that was intended  to take Sir Ernest  Shackleton  and a small  crew  of seamen  and scientists,  27 men in all, to the southernmost  shore  of Antarctica’s  Weddell  Sea. From  that point  Shackleton  wanted  to force  a passage  by dog sled (雪橇 ) across  the continent.  The journey  was intended  to achieve  more  than what  Captain  Robert  Falcon  Scott  had done.  Captain  Scott  had reached  the South  Pole early  in 1912  but had died with his four companions  on the march  back.  As writer  Caroline  Alexander  makes  clear  in her forceful  and well-researched  story  The Endurance , adventuring  was even  then a thoroughly  commercial  effort.  Scott’s  last journey,  completed  as he lay in a tent dying  of cold and hunger,  caught  the world’s  imagination,  and a film made  in his honor  drew  crowds.  Shackleton,  a onetime  British  merchant-navy  officer  who had got to within  100 miles  of the South  Pole in 1908,  started  a business  before  his 1914  voyage  to make  money  from  movie  and still photography.  Frank  Hurley,  a confident  and gifted  Australian  photographer  who knew  the Antarctic,  was hired  to make  the images,  most  of which  have  never  before  been  published.  33. What  do we know  about  the photos  taken  by Hurley?    A. They  were  made  last week.         B. They  showed  undersea  sceneries.  C. They  were  found  by a cameraman.   D.

They settled in at a comfortable East Side cafe and within minutes, another customer was approaching their table.“Hey, aren’t you from Mississippi?” the elegant, white-haired writer remembered being asked by the stranger. “I’m from Mississippi too.”   Without a second thought, the woman joined the Welty party. When her dinner partner showed up, she also pulled up a chair.“They began telling me all the news of Mississippi,” Welty said. “I didn’t know what my New York friends were thinking.”    Taxis on a rainy New York night are rarer than sunshine. By the time the group got up to leave, it was pouring outside. Welty’s new friends immediately sent a waiter to find a cab. Heading back downtown toward her hotel, her big-city friends were amazed at the turn of events that had changed their Big Apple dinner into a Mississippi state reunion (团聚).“My friends said: ‘Now we believe your stories,’” Welty added. “And I said: ‘Now you know. These are the people that make me write them.’”Sitting on a sofa in her room, Welty, a slim figure in a simple gray dress, looked pleased with this explanation.“I don’t make them up,” she said of the characters in her fiction these last 50 or so years. “I don’t have to.”Beauticians, bartenders, piano players and people with purple hats, Welty’s people come from afternoons spent visiting with old friends, from walks through the streets of her native Jackson, Miss., from conversations overheard on a bus. It annoys Welty that, at 78, her left ear has now given out. Sometimes, sitting on a bus or a train, she hears only a fragment (片段) of a particularly interesting story.25. What happened when Welty was with her friends at the cafe?A. Two strangers joined her.         B. Her childhood friends came in.  C. A heavy rain ruined the dinner.     D. Some people held a party there.26. The underlined word “them” in Paragraph 6 refers to Welty’s        .A. readers     \tB. parties     \tC. friends   \tD. stories27. What can we learn about the characters in Welty’s fiction?  A. They live in big cities.            \tB. They are mostly women.  C. They come from real life.          D. They are pleasure seekers.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, best_of=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=-1, min_p=0.0, seed=None, use_beam_search=False, length_penalty=1.0, early_stopping=False, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=512, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None), prompt_token_ids: [151644, 8948, 198, 2610, 525, 264, 10950, 17847, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 872, 198, 56568, 101909, 22574, 101057, 3837, 100638, 31838, 89012, 106367, 14582, 25, 425, 1925, 825, 315, 1059, 22466, 311, 1532, 4261, 3807, 1635, 4134, 11, 468, 661, 6215, 25006, 1881, 6635, 311, 1896, 264, 5625, 315, 1532, 4261, 4780, 700, 311, 13856, 13, 2379, 22378, 304, 518, 264, 10655, 6326, 16659, 40930, 323, 2878, 4420, 11, 2441, 6002, 572, 29947, 862, 1965, 34047, 18665, 11, 7629, 1405, 498, 504, 28438, 12390, 279, 25777, 11, 4158, 67379, 6916, 26471, 1660, 4588, 553, 279, 33958, 13, 1036, 40, 4249, 504, 28438, 2238, 1987, 256, 17147, 264, 2086, 3381, 11, 279, 5220, 10859, 279, 25006, 1881, 4614, 13, 3197, 1059, 13856, 8263, 8542, 705, 11, 1340, 1083, 13238, 705, 264, 10496, 34047, 6865, 6009, 11629, 752, 678, 279, 3669, 315, 28438, 2419, 25006, 1881, 1053, 13, 1036, 40, 3207, 1405, 1414, 1128, 847, 1532, 4261, 4780, 1033, 7274, 1987, 262, 350, 7184, 389, 264, 62757, 1532, 4261, 3729, 525, 435, 60470, 1091, 51395, 13, 3216, 279, 882, 279, 1874, 2684, 705, 311, 5274, 11, 432, 572, 50413, 4889, 13, 25006, 1881, 748, 501, 4780, 7069, 3208, 264, 67169, 311, 1477, 264, 21516, 13, 51349, 1182, 18907, 8841, 1059, 9500, 11, 1059, 2409, 53329, 4780, 1033, 45204, 518, 279, 2484, 315, 4357, 429, 1030, 5497, 862, 6164, 8162, 13856, 1119, 264, 28438, 1584, 57284, 320, 99305, 99642, 568, 2073, 5050, 4780, 1053, 25, 3369, 7039, 582, 4411, 697, 7343, 91164, 25006, 1881, 3694, 13, 1036, 3036, 358, 1053, 25, 3369, 7039, 498, 1414, 13, 4220, 525, 279, 1251, 429, 1281, 752, 3270, 1105, 14304, 854, 50, 14810, 389, 264, 31069, 304, 1059, 3054, 11, 25006, 1881, 11, 264, 29353, 7071, 304, 264, 4285, 17545, 8511, 11, 6966, 18442, 448, 419, 16148, 34047, 40, 1513, 1405, 1281, 1105, 705, 2419, 1340, 1053, 315, 279, 5766, 304, 1059, 16989, 1493, 1537, 220, 20, 15, 476, 773, 1635, 13, 1036, 40, 1513, 1405, 614, 311, 1987, 3430, 2717, 9621, 11, 61518, 14506, 11, 26278, 4217, 323, 1251, 448, 24932, 44426, 11, 25006, 1881, 748, 1251, 2525, 504, 1283, 2152, 2382, 7391, 16721, 448, 2310, 4780, 11, 504, 22479, 1526, 279, 14371, 315, 1059, 9867, 13658, 11, 8906, 2572, 504, 20959, 916, 54503, 389, 264, 5828, 13, 1084, 18344, 1047, 25006, 1881, 429, 11, 518, 220, 22, 23, 11, 1059, 2115, 2430, 702, 1431, 2661, 700, 13, 17688, 11, 11699, 389, 264, 5828, 476, 264, 5426, 11, 1340, 52059, 1172, 264, 12289, 320, 115076, 8, 315, 264, 7945, 7040, 3364, 13, 17, 20, 13, 3555, 6932, 979, 25006, 1881, 572, 448, 1059, 4780, 518, 279, 40930, 30, 32, 13, 9043, 39621, 10859, 1059, 13, 260, 425, 13, 6252, 19990, 4780, 3697, 304, 13, 220, 356, 13, 362, 8811, 11174, 46068, 279, 13856, 13, 257, 422, 13, 4329, 1251, 5644, 264, 4614, 1052, 13, 17, 21, 13, 576, 1212, 15121, 3409, 1036, 48718, 854, 304, 49351, 220, 21, 19257, 311, 25006, 1881, 748, 286, 659, 32, 13, 12726, 414, 12791, 13, 9677, 414, 6258, 13, 4780, 262, 10957, 13, 7343, 17, 22, 13, 3555, 646, 582, 3960, 911, 279, 5766, 304, 25006, 1881, 748, 16989, 30, 220, 362, 13, 2379, 3887, 304, 2409, 9720, 13, 1797, 12791, 13, 2379, 525, 10008, 3198, 13, 220, 356, 13, 2379, 2525, 504, 1931, 2272, 13, 688, 422, 13, 2379, 525, 16656, 49333, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198], lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

It’s called Apple Day but in practice it’s more like Apple Month. The day itself is on October 21, but since it has caught on, events now spread out over most of October around Britain.Visiting an apple event is a good chance to see, and often taste, a wide variety of apples. To people who are used to the limited choice of apples such as Golden Delicious and Royal Gala in supermarkets, it can be quite an eye opener to see the range of classical apples still in existence, such as Decio which was grown by the Romans. Although it doesn’t taste of anything special, it’s still worth a try, as is the knobbly (多疙瘩的) Cat’s Head which is more of a curiosity than anything else.There are also varieties developed to suit specific local conditions. One of the very best varieties for eating quality is Orleans Reinette, but you’ll need a warm, sheltered place with perfect soil to grow it, so it’s a pipe dream for most apple lovers who fall for it.At the events, you can meet expert growers and discuss which ones will best suit your conditions, and because these are family affairs, children are well catered for with apple-themed fun and games.Apple Days are being held at all sorts of places with an interest in fruit, including stately gardens and commercial orchards (果园). If you want to have a real orchard experience, try visiting the National Fruit Collection at Brogdale, near Faversham in Kent.28. What can people do at the apple events?A. Attend experts’ lectures.             \tB. Visit fruit-loving families.C. Plant fruit trees in an orchard.     \t\tD. Taste many kinds of apples.29. What can we learn about Decio?A. It is a new variety.                \tB. It has a strange look.C. It is rarely seen now.               \tD. It has a special taste.30. What does the underlined phrase “a pipe dream” in Paragraph 3 mean?A. A practical idea.  \tB. A vain hope.  C. A brilliant plan.  D. A selfish desire.31. What is the author’s purpose in writing the text?A. To show how to grow apples.      B. To introduce an apple festival.C. To help people select apples.       D. To promote apple research.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, best_of=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=-1, min_p=0.0, seed=None, use_beam_search=False, length_penalty=1.0, early_stopping=False, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=512, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None), prompt_token_ids: [151644, 8948, 198, 2610, 525, 264, 10950, 17847, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 872, 198, 56568, 101909, 22574, 101057, 3837, 100638, 31838, 89012, 106367, 14582, 25, 356, 2679, 498, 525, 264, 13779, 3063, 261, 1959, 476, 1035, 1075, 311, 3635, 825, 1959, 1896, 9423, 315, 8162, 6059, 311, 1490, 1128, 748, 2163, 13, 1084, 748, 2598, 8162, 6059, 714, 304, 6588, 432, 748, 803, 1075, 8162, 19397, 13, 576, 1899, 5086, 374, 389, 6527, 220, 17, 16, 11, 714, 2474, 432, 702, 10568, 389, 11, 4357, 1431, 8865, 700, 916, 1429, 315, 6527, 2163, 13224, 13, 3120, 5853, 458, 23268, 1538, 374, 264, 1661, 6012, 311, 1490, 11, 323, 3545, 12656, 11, 264, 6884, 8045, 315, 40676, 13, 2014, 1251, 879, 525, 1483, 311, 279, 7199, 5754, 315, 40676, 1741, 438, 17809, 84688, 323, 16194, 75441, 304, 76499, 11, 432, 646, 387, 5008, 458, 7912, 35153, 311, 1490, 279, 2088, 315, 28824, 40676, 2058, 304, 13885, 11, 1741, 438, 3714, 815, 892, 572, 14700, 553, 279, 48717, 13, 10328, 432, 3171, 1405, 12656, 315, 4113, 3281, 11, 432, 748, 2058, 5802, 264, 1430, 11, 438, 374, 279, 1148, 20415, 398, 320, 42140, 119338, 119475, 9370, 8, 17358, 748, 11203, 892, 374, 803, 315, 264, 40228, 1091, 4113, 770, 52307, 525, 1083, 35580, 7881, 311, 7781, 3151, 2205, 4682, 13, 3776, 315, 279, 1602, 1850, 35580, 369, 12182, 4271, 374, 25919, 46069, 6535, 11, 714, 498, 4700, 1184, 264, 8205, 11, 22906, 291, 1992, 448, 4727, 17171, 311, 3063, 432, 11, 773, 432, 748, 264, 13647, 7904, 369, 1429, 23268, 32118, 879, 4399, 369, 432, 15543, 279, 4357, 11, 498, 646, 3367, 6203, 68977, 323, 4263, 892, 6174, 686, 1850, 7781, 697, 4682, 11, 323, 1576, 1493, 525, 2997, 21978, 11, 2841, 525, 1632, 27968, 291, 369, 448, 23268, 56589, 2464, 323, 3868, 5105, 273, 21192, 525, 1660, 5644, 518, 678, 20853, 315, 7482, 448, 458, 2734, 304, 13779, 11, 2670, 357, 2652, 35436, 323, 8353, 40145, 2347, 320, 115671, 568, 1416, 498, 1366, 311, 614, 264, 1931, 40145, 567, 3139, 11, 1430, 16721, 279, 5055, 43087, 11101, 518, 5906, 28584, 1574, 11, 3143, 434, 21565, 5604, 304, 17734, 13, 17, 23, 13, 3555, 646, 1251, 653, 518, 279, 23268, 4357, 30, 32, 13, 78773, 11647, 527, 45132, 13, 1060, 12791, 13, 19008, 13779, 76600, 8521, 727, 13, 17838, 13779, 12408, 304, 458, 40145, 567, 13, 85065, 10957, 13, 57981, 1657, 12829, 315, 40676, 13, 17, 24, 13, 3555, 646, 582, 3960, 911, 3714, 815, 30, 32, 13, 1084, 374, 264, 501, 8045, 13, 338, 12791, 13, 1084, 702, 264, 14888, 1401, 727, 13, 1084, 374, 18521, 3884, 1431, 13, 394, 10957, 13, 1084, 702, 264, 3281, 12656, 13, 18, 15, 13, 3555, 1558, 279, 1212, 15121, 17133, 1036, 64, 13647, 7904, 854, 304, 49351, 220, 18, 3076, 30, 32, 13, 362, 14976, 4522, 13, 256, 12791, 13, 362, 45504, 3900, 13, 220, 356, 13, 362, 19752, 3119, 13, 220, 422, 13, 362, 44643, 12591, 13, 18, 16, 13, 3555, 374, 279, 3150, 748, 7428, 304, 4378, 279, 1467, 30, 32, 13, 2014, 1473, 1246, 311, 3063, 40676, 13, 414, 425, 13, 2014, 19131, 458, 23268, 18780, 727, 13, 2014, 1492, 1251, 3293, 40676, 13, 981, 422, 13, 2014, 11926, 23268, 3412, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198], lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

If it bleeds, it leads. No news is good news, and good news is no news. Those are the classic rules for the evening broadcasts and the morning papers. But now that information is being spread and monitored (监控) in different ways, researchers are discovering new rules. By tracking people’s e-mails and online posts, scientists have found that good news can spread faster and farther than disasters and sob stories.   “The ‘if it bleeds’ rule works for mass media,” says Jonah Berger, a scholar at the University of Pennsylvania. “They want your eyeballs and don’t care how you’re feeling. But when you share a story with your friends, you care a lot more how they react. You don’t want them to think of you as a Debbie Downer.”   Researchers analyzing word-of-mouth communication — e-mails, Web posts and reviews, face-to-face conversations — found that it tended to be more positive than negative (消极的), but that didn’t necessarily mean people preferred positive news. Was positive news shared more often simply because people experienced more good things than bad things? To test for that possibility, Dr. Berger looked at how people spread a particular set of news stories: thousands of articles on The New York Times’ website. He and a Penn colleague analyzed the “most e-mailed” list for six months. One of his first findings was that articles in the science section were much more likely to make the list than non-science articles. He found that science amazed Times’ readers and made them want to share this positive feeling with others.Readers also tended to share articles that were exciting or funny, or that inspired negative feelings like anger or anxiety, but not articles that left them merely sad. They needed to be aroused (激发) one way or the other, and they preferred good news to bad. The more positive an article, the more likely it was to be shared, as Dr. Berger explains in his new book, “Contagious: Why Things Catch On.” 32.

Trying  to help injured,  displaced  or sick creatures  can be heartbreaking;  survival  is never  certain.  However,  when  it works,  it is simply  beautiful.   I got a rescue  call from  a woman  in Muttontown.  She had found  a young  owl (猫头鹰 ) on the ground.  When  I arrived,  I saw a 2-to 3-week-old  owl. It had already  been  placed  in a carrier  for safety.   I examined  the chick  (雏鸟 ) and it seemed  fine. If I could  locate  the nest, I might  have  been  able to put it back,  but no luck.  My next work  was to construct  a nest and anchor  it in a tree.  The homeowner  was very helpful.  A wire basket  was found.  I put some  pine branches  into the basket  to make  this nest safe and comfortable.  I placed  the chick  in the nest, and it quickly  calmed  down.   Now  all that was needed  were  the parents,  but they were  absent.  I gave  the homeowner  a recording  of the hunger  screams  of owl chicks.  These  advertise  the presence  of chicks  to adults;  they might  also encourage  our chick  to start calling  as well.  I gave  the owner  as much  information  as possible  and headed  home  to see what  news  the night  might  bring.   A nervous  night  to be sure,  but sometimes  the spirits  of nature  smile  on us all!   The homeowner  called  to say that the parents  had responded  to the recordings.  I drove  over and saw the chick  in the nest looking  healthy  and active.  And it was accompanied  in the nest by the greatest  sight  of all — LUNCH!  The parents  had done  their duty and would  probably  continue  to do so. 24. What  is unavoidable  in the author’s  rescue  work  according  to paragraph  1? A.

UNESCO(  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and Cultural  Organization)  recently  set April  30 as a day to raise  awareness  of jazz music,  its significance,  and its potential  as a unifying  (联合 ) voice  across  cultures.  Despite  the celebrations,  though,  in the U.S. the jazz audience  continues  to shrink  and grow  older,  and the music  has failed  to connect  with younger  generations.  It’s Jason  Moran’s  job to help change  that. As the Kennedy  Center’s  artistic  adviser  for jazz, Moran  hopes  to widen  the audience  for jazz, make  the music  more  accessible,  and preserve  its history  and culture.  “Jazz  seems  like it’s not really  a part of the American  appetite,”  Moran  tells National  Public  Radio’s  reporter  Neal  Conan.  “What  I’m hoping  to accomplish  is that my generation  and younger  start to reconsider  and understand  that jazz is not black  and write  anymore.  It’s actually  color,  and it’s actually  digital.”    Moran  says one of the problems  with jazz today  is that the entertainment  aspect  of the music  has been  lost. “The  music  can’t  be presented  today  the way it was in 1908  or 1958.  It has to continue  to move,  because  the way the world  works  is not the same,”  says Moran.  Last year,  Moran  worked  on a project  that arranged  Fats Waller’s  music  for a dance  party,  “Just  to kind of put it back  in the mind  that Waller  is dance  music  as much  as it is concert  music,”  says Moran.  “For me, it’s the recontextualization.  In music,  where  does the emotion  (情感 ) lie? Are we, as humans,  gaining  any insight  (感悟 ) on how to talk about  ourselves  and how something  as abstract  as a Charlie  Parker  record  gets us into a dialogue  about  our emotions  and our thoughts?  Sometimes  we lose sight  that the music  has a wider  context,”  says Moran,  “so I want  to continue  those  dialogues.  Those  are the things  I want  to foster.”  28. Why  did UNESCO  set April  30 as International  Jazz Day?  A. To remember  the birth  of jazz. B. To protect  cultural  diversity.  C. To encourage  people  to study  music.  D. To recognize  the value  of jazz. 29. What  does the underlined  word  “that”  in paragraph  3 refer  to? A. Jazz becoming  more  accessible.  B. The production  of jazz growing  faster.  C. Jazz being  less popular  with the young.  D. The jazz audience  becoming  larger.   30. What  can we infer  about  Moran’s  opinion  on jazz?  A. It will disappear  gradually.          B. It remains  black  and white.  C. It should  keep  up with the times.     D. It changes  every  50 years.  31. Which  of the following  can be the best title for the text?  A. Exploring  the Future  of Jazz.     B. The Rise and Fall of Jazz.  C. The Story  of a Jazz Musician.     D. Celebrating  the Jazz Day.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, best_of=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0,

Developed  by two doctors  in the U.S. Department  of Agriculture,  it’s an excellent  water  collector.  Unfortunately,  you must  carry  the necessary  equipment  with you, since  it’s all but impossible  to find natural  substitutes.  The only components  required,  though,  are a 5'×5'  sheet  of clear  or slightly  milky  plastic,  six feet of plastic  tube,  and a container  — perhaps  just a drinking  cup — to catch  the water.  These  pieces  can be folded  into a neat little pack  and fastened  on your belt.     To construct  a working  still, use a sharp  stick  or rock to dig a hole four feet across  and three  feet deep.  Try to make  the hole in a damp  area to increase  the water  catcher’s  productivity.  Place  your cup in the deepest  part of the hole.  Then  lay the tube in place  so that one end rests all the way in the cup and the rest of the line runs up — and out — the side of the hole.  Next,  cover  the hole with the plastic  sheet,  securing  the edges  of the plastic  with dirt and weighting  the sheet’s  center  down  with a rock.  The plastic  should  now form  a cone  (圆锥体 ) with 45-degree-angled  sides.  The low point  of the sheet  must  be centered  directly  over,  and no more  than three  inches  above,  the cup.  The solar  still works  by creating  a greenhouse  under  the plastic.  Ground  water  evaporates  (蒸发 ) and collects  on the sheet  until small  drops  of water  form,  run down  the material  and fall off into the cup. When  the container  is full, you can suck the refreshment  out through  the tube,  and won’t  have  to break  down  the still every  time you need  a drink.   32. What  do we know  about  the solar  still equipment  from  the first paragraph?  A. It’s delicate.    B. It’s expensive.    C. It’s complex.    D. It’s portable.  33. What  does the underlined  phrase  “the water  catcher”  in paragraph  2 refer  to? A. The tube.       B. The still.       C. The hole.       D. The cup. 34.

When  the studio  didn’t  want  me for the film — it wanted  somebody  as well known  as Paul — he stood  up for me. I don’t  know  how many  people  would  have  done  that; they would  have  listened  to their agents  or the studio  powers.  The friendship  that grew  out of the experience  of making  that film and The Sting  four years  later had its root in the fact that although  there  was an age difference,  we both came  from  a tradition  of theater  and live TV. We were  respectful  of craft（技艺）and focused  on digging  into the characters  we were  going  to play.  Both  of us had the qualities  and virtues  that are typical  of American  actors:  humorous,  aggressive,  and making  fun of each other  — but always  with an underlying  affection.  Those  were  also at the core（核心） of our relationship  off the screen.  We shared  the brief  that if you’re  fortunate  enough  to have  success,  you should    put something  back  — he with his Newman’s  Own  food and his Hole  in the Wall  camps  for kids who are seriously  ill, and me with Sundance  and the institute  and the festival.  Paul and I didn’t  see each other  all that regularly,  but sharing  that brought  us together.  We supported  each other  financially  and by showing  up at events.  I last saw him a few months  ago. He’d  been  in and out of the hospital.  He and I both knew  what  the deal was, and we didn’t  talk about  it. Ours  was a relationship  that didn’t  need  a lot of words.  24. Why  was the studio  unwilling  to give the role to author  at first?  A. Paul Newman  wanted  it.        B. The studio  powers  didn’t  like his agent.  C. He wasn’t  famous  enough.       D. The director  recommended  someone  else. 25. Why  did Paul and the author  have  a lasting  friendship?  A. They  were  of the same  age.       B. They  worked  in the same  theater.  C. They  were  both good  actors.       D. They  had similar  charactertics.  26.

The vehicle  — named  the Transition  – has two seats , four wheels  and wings  that fold up so it can be driven  like a car. The Transition,  which  flew at 1,400  feet for eight  minutes  last month,  can reach  around  70 miles  per hour on the road and 115 in the air. It flies using  a 23-gallon  tank of gas and bums  5 gallons  per hour in the air. On the ground,  it gets 35 miles  per gallon.  Around  100 people  have  already  put down  a $10,000  deposit  to get a Transition  when  they go on sale, and those  numbers  will likely  rise after Terrafugia  introduces    the Transition  to the public  later this week  at the New  York  Auto  Show.  But don’t  expect  it to show  up in too many  driveways.  It’s expected  to cost $279,000.  And it won’t  help if you’re  stuck  in traffic.  The car needs  a runway.  Inventors  have  been  trying  to make  flying  cars since  the 1930s,  according  to Robert  Mann,  an airline  industry  expert.  But Mann  thinks  Terrafugia  has come  closer  than anyone  to making  the flying  car a reality.  The govemment  has already  permitted  the company  to use special  materials  to make  it easier  for the vehicle  to fly. The Transition  is now going  through  crash  tests to make  sure it meets  federal  safety  standards.  Mann  said Terrafugia  was helped  by the Federal  Aviation  Administration’s  decision  five years  ago to create  a separate  set of standards  for light sport  aircraft,  which  are lower  than those  pilots  of larger  planes . Terrafugia  says an owner  would  need  to pass a test and complete  20 hours  of flying  time to be able to fly the Transition,  a requirement  pilots  would  find redatively  easy to meet.  28. What  is the first paragraph  mainly  about?  A. The basic  data of the Transition.      B. The advantages  of flying  cars. C. The potential  market  for flying  cars.  D. The designers  of the Transition.  29. Why  is the Transition  unlikely  to show  up in too many  driveways?  A. It causes  traffic  jams.              B. It is difficult  to operate.  C.

Back  in 1983,  two scientists,  Jack Schultz  and Ian Baldwin,  reported  that young  maple  trees  getting  bitten  by insects  send out a particular  smell  that neighboring  plants  can get. These    chemicals  come  from  the injured  parts  of the plant  and seem  to be an alarm.  What  the plants  pump  through  the air is a mixture  of chemicals  known  as volatile  organic  compounds,  VOCs  for short.  Scientists  have  found  that all kinds  of plants  give out VOCs  when  being  attacked.  It’s a plant’s  way of crying  out. But is anyone  listening?  Apparently.  Because  we can watch  the neighbours  react.  Some  plants  pump  out smelly  chemicals  to keep  insects  away.  But others  do double  duty.  They  pump  out perfumes  designed  to attract  different  insects  who are natural  enemies  to the attackers.  Once  they arrive,  the tables  are turned . The attacker  who was lunching  now becomes  lunch.  In study  after study,  it appears  that these  chemical  conversations  help the neighbors.  The damage  is usually  more  serious  on the first plant,  but the neighbors,  relatively  speaking,  stay safer  because  they heard  the alarm  and knew  what  to do. Does  this mean  that plants  talk to each other?  Scientists  don’t  know.  Maybe  the first plant  just made  a cry of pain or was sending  a message  to its own branches,  and so, in effect,  was talking  to itself.  Perhaps  the neighbors  just happened  to “overhear”  the cry. So information  was exchanged,  but it wasn’t  a true, intentional  back  and forth.  Charles  Darwin,  over 150 years  ago, imagined  a world  far busier,  noisier  and more  intimate  (亲密的 ) than the world  we can see and hear.  Our senses  are weak.  There’s  a whole  lot going  on. 32. What  does a plant  do when  it is under  attack?  A. It makes  noises.      B. It gets help from  other  plants.  C. It stands  quietly      D. It sends  out certain  chemicals.  33. What  does the author  mean  by “the tables  are turned”  in paragraph  3? A. The attackers  get attacked.  B. The insects  gather  under  the table.  C. The plants  get ready  to fight  back.  D. The perfumes  attract  natural  enemies.  34. Scientists  find from  their studies  that plants  can           .

It was a scene that had been repeated many times in the theater’s 75-year history. This time, however, the cleanup was a little different. As one group of workers carried out the rubbish, another group began removing seats and other theater equipment in preparation for the building’s end.The film classic The Last Picture Show was the last movie shown in the old theater. Though the movie is 30 years old, most of the 250 seats were filled with teary-eyed audience wanting to say good-bye to the old building. Theater owner Ed Bradford said he chose the movie because it seemed appropriate. The movie is set in a small town where the only movie theater is preparing to close down.Bradford said that large modern theaters in the city made it impossible for the Plaza to compete. He added that the theater’s location (位置) was also a reason. “This used to be the center of town,” he said. “Now the area is mostly office buildings and warehouses.”Last week some city officials suggested the city might be interested in turning the old theater into a museum and public meeting place. However, these plans were abandoned because of financial problems. Bradford sold the building and land to a local development firm, which plans to build a shopping complex on the land where the theater is located.The theater audience said good-bye as Bradford locked the doors for the last time. After 75 years the Plaza Theater has shown its last movie. The theater will be missed.24. In what way was yesterday’s cleanup at the Plaza special?A. It made room for new equipment.B. It signaled the closedown of the theater.C. It was done with the help of the audience.D. It marked the 75th anniversary of the theater.25. Why was The Last Picture Show put on?A. It was an all-time classic.     \t\tB. It was about the history of the town.C. The audience requested it.     \tD. The theater owner found it suitable.26. What will probably happen to the building?A. It will be repaired.      \t\tB. It will be turned into a museum.C. It will be knocked down.    \tD. It will be sold to the city government. 27. What can we infer about the audience?A. They are disappointed with Bradford.  B. They are sad to part with the old theater. C. They are supportive of the city officials.  D. They are eager to have a shopping center.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, best_of=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=-1, min_p=0.0, seed=None, use_beam_search=False, length_penalty=1.0, early_stopping=False, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=512, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None), prompt_token_ids: [151644, 8948, 198, 2610, 525, 264, 10950, 17847, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 872, 198, 56568, 101909, 22574, 101057, 3837, 100638, 31838, 89012, 106367, 14582, 25, 425, 27720, 1283, 279, 1537, 5700, 9482, 13671, 518, 279, 40307, 37471, 11, 8256, 1033, 13028, 40971, 705, 69705, 82, 323, 22888, 83323, 25374, 13, 1084, 572, 264, 6109, 429, 1030, 1012, 11504, 1657, 3039, 304, 279, 26705, 748, 220, 22, 20, 4666, 3840, 13, 1096, 882, 11, 4764, 11, 279, 21290, 572, 264, 2632, 2155, 13, 1634, 825, 1874, 315, 7337, 11691, 700, 279, 60924, 11, 2441, 1874, 6009, 17592, 16312, 323, 1008, 26705, 7096, 304, 17975, 369, 279, 4752, 748, 835, 11568, 4531, 11416, 576, 7996, 24568, 6928, 572, 279, 1537, 5700, 6839, 304, 279, 2310, 26705, 13, 17594, 279, 5700, 374, 220, 18, 15, 1635, 2310, 11, 1429, 315, 279, 220, 17, 20, 15, 16312, 1033, 10199, 448, 1013, 658, 52513, 10650, 19211, 311, 1977, 1661, 1455, 9011, 311, 279, 2310, 4752, 13, 37471, 6372, 3199, 59829, 1053, 566, 14554, 279, 5700, 1576, 432, 9324, 8311, 13, 576, 5700, 374, 738, 304, 264, 2613, 6290, 1380, 279, 1172, 5700, 26705, 374, 20045, 311, 3265, 1495, 1785, 13281, 8187, 1053, 429, 3460, 6481, 43766, 304, 279, 3283, 1865, 432, 11997, 369, 279, 40307, 311, 20259, 13, 1260, 3694, 429, 279, 26705, 748, 3728, 320, 81812, 8, 572, 1083, 264, 2874, 13, 1036, 1986, 1483, 311, 387, 279, 4126, 315, 6290, 2419, 566, 1053, 13, 1036, 7039, 279, 3082, 374, 10008, 5163, 13702, 323, 82173, 1987, 5842, 2003, 1045, 3283, 7359, 11827, 279, 3283, 2578, 387, 8014, 304, 13054, 279, 2310, 26705, 1119, 264, 23971, 323, 584, 6438, 1992, 13, 4354, 11, 1493, 6649, 1033, 22978, 1576, 315, 5896, 5322, 13, 59829, 6088, 279, 4752, 323, 4268, 311, 264, 2205, 4401, 7474, 11, 892, 6649, 311, 1936, 264, 11919, 6351, 389, 279, 4268, 1380, 279, 26705, 374, 7407, 11568, 26705, 10650, 1053, 1661, 1455, 9011, 438, 59829, 16061, 279, 14038, 369, 279, 1537, 882, 13, 4636, 220, 22, 20, 1635, 279, 40307, 37471, 702, 6839, 1181, 1537, 5700, 13, 576, 26705, 686, 387, 13628, 13, 17, 19, 13, 758, 1128, 1616, 572, 13671, 748, 21290, 518, 279, 40307, 3281, 30, 32, 13, 1084, 1865, 3054, 369, 501, 7096, 1785, 13, 1084, 74748, 279, 7877, 779, 315, 279, 26705, 727, 13, 1084, 572, 2814, 448, 279, 1492, 315, 279, 10650, 909, 13, 1084, 12864, 279, 220, 22, 20, 339, 21582, 315, 279, 26705, 13, 17, 20, 13, 8429, 572, 576, 7996, 24568, 6928, 2182, 389, 30, 32, 13, 1084, 572, 458, 678, 7246, 11416, 13, 85065, 12791, 13, 1084, 572, 911, 279, 3840, 315, 279, 6290, 727, 13, 576, 10650, 11223, 432, 13, 414, 10957, 13, 576, 26705, 6372, 1730, 432, 14452, 13, 17, 21, 13, 3555, 686, 4658, 3537, 311, 279, 4752, 30, 32, 13, 1084, 686, 387, 51734, 13, 51370, 12791, 13, 1084, 686, 387, 6519, 1119, 264, 23971, 727, 13, 1084, 686, 387, 31985, 1495, 13, 257, 10957, 13, 1084, 686, 387, 6088, 311, 279, 3283, 3033, 13, 220, 17, 22, 13, 3555, 646, 582, 23583, 911, 279, 10650, 30, 32, 13, 2379, 525, 24402, 448, 59829, 13, 220, 425, 13, 2379, 525, 12421, 311, 949, 448, 279, 2310, 26705, 13, 356, 13, 2379, 525, 32345, 315, 279, 3283, 7359, 13, 220, 422, 13, 2379, 525, 23541, 311, 614, 264, 11919, 4126, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198], lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Fourteen wolves were caught in Canada and transported to the park. By last year, the Yellowstone wolf population had grown to more than 170 wolves.Gray wolves once were seen here and there in the Yellowstone area and much of the continental United States, but they were gradually displaced by human development. By the 1920s, wolves had practically disappeared from the Yellowstone area. They went farther north into the deep forests of Canada, where there were fewer humans around.The disappearance of the wolves had many unexpected results. Deer and elk populations — major food sources (来源) for the wolf — grew rapidly. These animals consumed large amounts of vegetation (植被), which reduced plant diversity in the park. In the absence of wolves, coyote populations also grew quickly. The coyotes killed a large percentage of the park’s red foxes, and completely drove away the park’s beavers.As early as 1966, biologists asked the government to consider reintroducing wolves to Yellowstone Park. They hoped that wolves would be able to control the elk and coyote problems. Many farmers opposed the plan because they feared that wolves would kill their farm animals or pets.    The government spent nearly 30 years coming up with a plan to reintroduce the wolvers. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service carefully monitors and manages the wolf packs in Yellowstone. Today, the debate continues over how well the gray wolf is fitting in at Yellowstone. Elk, deer, and coyote populations are down, while beavers and red fores have made a comeback. The Yellowstone wolf project has been a valuable experiment to help biologists decide whether to reintroduce wolves to other parts of the country as well.28. What is the text mainly about?A. Wildlife research in the United States.B. Plant diversity in the Yellowstone area.C. The conflict between farmers and gray wolves.D. The reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone Park.29.

Phil Blythe explains: “For many older people, particularly those living alone or in the country, driving is important for preserving their independence, giving them the freedom to get out and about without having to rely on others.”“But we all have to accept that as we get older our reactions slow down and this often results in people avoiding any potentially challenging driving conditions and losing confidence in their driving skills. The result is that people stop driving before they really need to.”Dr Amy Guo, the leading researcher on the older driver study, explains, “The Drive LAB is helping us to understand what the key points and difficulties are for older drivers and how we might use technology to address these problems.“For example, most of us would expect older drivers always go slower than everyone else but surprisingly, we found that in 30mph zones they struggled to keep at a constant speed and so were more likely to break the speed limit and be at risk of getting fined. We’re looking at the benefits of systems which control their speed as a way of preventing that.“We hope that our work will help with technological solutions (解决方案) to ensure that older drivers stay safer behind the wheel.”32. What is the purpose of the Drive LAB?A. To explore newmeans of transport.       B. To design new types of cars.C. To find out older driver’s problems.      D. To teach people traffic rules.33. Why is driving important for older people according to Phil Blythe?A. It keeps them independent.      B. It helps them save time.C. It builds up their strength.       D. It cures their mental illnesses.34. What do researchers hope to do for older drivers?A. Improve their driving skills.         B. Develop driver-assist technologles.C. Provide tips on repairing their cars.   D. Organize regular physical checkups.35. What is the best title for the text?A. A new Model Electric Car      B. A Solution to Traffic ProblemC.

When  the the world  was still   populated  by hunter-gatherers,  small,  tightly  knit (联系 ) groups  developed  their own patterns  of speech  independent  of each other.  Some  language  experts  believe  that 10,000  years  ago, when  the world  had just five to ten million  people,  they spoke  perhaps  12,000  languages  between  them.  Soon  afterwards,  many  of those  people  started  settling  down  to become  farmers,  and their languages  too became  more  settled  and fewer  in number.  In recent  centres,  trade,  industrialisation , the development  of the nation-state  and the spread  of universal  compulsory  education.  Especially  glbalisation  and better  communications  in the past few decades,  all have  caused  many  Languages  to disappear,  and dominant  languages  such as English . Spanish  and Chinese  are increasingly  taking  over.  At present,  the world  has about  6,800 languages.  The distribution  of these  languages  is hugely  uneven.  The general  rule is that mild zones  have  relatively  few languages.  Often  spoken  by many  people  while  hot, wet zones  have  lots, often  spoken  by small  numbers.  Europe  has only around  200 Languages:  the Americas  about  1,000.  Africa  2,400; and Asia and the Pacific  perhaps  3,200,  of which  Papua  New  Guinea  alone  accounts  for well over 800. The median  number  (中位数 ) of speakers  is a mere  6.000,  which  means  that half the worlds  languages  are spoken  by fewer  people  than that. Already  well over 400 of the total of 6,800  languages  are close  to extinction( 消亡), with only a few elderly  speakers  left. Pick,  at random,  Busuu  in Cameroon  (eight  remaining  speakers),  Chiapaneco  in Mexico(150).  Lipan  Apache  in the United  States  (two or three)  or Wadjigu  in Australia  (one,  with a question-mark):  none  of these  seems  to have  much  chance  of survival.  28. What  can we infer  about  languages  in huntergatherer  times?   A.They  developed  very fast.    B. They  were  large  in number.  C. They  had similar  patters.     D. They  were  closely  connected  29. Which  of the following  best explains  “dominant ” underlined  in paragraph  2？ A.Complex.     B. Advanced.       C.Powerful.     D.Modem.  30. How  many  languages  are spoken  by less than 6,000  people  at present?    A.About  6,800.   B.About  3,400.     C.About  2,400.   D.About  1,200.   31. What  is the min idea of the text?   A.

That’s  bad news  for the environment  — and our wallets  — as these  outdated  devices  consume  much  more  energy  than the newer  ones that do the same  things.  To figure  out how much  power  these  devices  are using,  Callie  Babbitt  and her colleagues  at the Rochester  Institute  of Technology  in New  York  tracked  the environmental  costs  for each product  throughout  its life — from  when  its minerals  are mined  to when  we stop using  the device.  This method  provided  a readout  for how home  energy  use has evolved  since  the early  1990s.  Devices  were  grouped  by generation  — Desktop  computers,  basic  mobile  phones,  and box-set  TVs defined  1992.  Digital  cameras  arrived  on the scene  in 1997.  And MP3  players,  smart  phones,  and LCD  TVs entered  homes  in 2002,  before  tablets  and e-readers  showed  up in 2007.  As we accumulated  more  devices,  however,  we didn ’t throw  out our old ones.  “The living-room  television  is replaced  and gets planted  in the kids’ room,  and suddenly  one day, you have  a TV in every  room  of the house, ” said one researcher.  The average  number  of electronic  devices  rose from  four per household  in 1992  to 13 in 2007.  We’re not just keeping  these  old devices  — we continue  to use them.  According  to the analysis  of Babbitt ’s team,  old desktop  monitors  and box TVs with cathode  ray tubes  are the worst  devices  with their energy  consumption  and contribution  to greenhouse  gas emissions （排放） more  than doubling  during  the 1992  to 2007  window.    So what ’s the solution（解决方案） ? The team ’s data only went  up to 2007,  but the researchers  also explored  what  would  happen  if consumers  replaced  old products  with new electronics  that serve  more  than one function,  such as a tablet  for word  processing  and TV viewing.  They  found  that more  on-demand  entertainment  viewing  on tablets  instead  of TVs and desktop  computers  could  cut energy  consumption  by 44%.  32. What  does the author  think  of new devices?  A. They  are environment-friendly.   B. They  are no better  than the old. C. They  cost more  to use at home.   D. They  go out of style  quickly.  33. Why  did Babbitt's  team  conduct  the research?  A. To reduce  the cost of minerals.  B. To test the life cycle  of a product.  C. To update  consumers  on new technology.  D. To find out electricity  consumption  of the devices.  34. Which  of the following  uses the least energy?  A. The box-set  TV.    B. The tablet.  C. The LCD  TV.    D. The desktop  computer.  35. What  does the text suggest  people  do about  old electronic  devices?  A. Stop using  them.    B. Take  them  apart.  C. Upgrade  them.     D. Recycle  them.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", params: SamplingParams(n=1, best_of=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=-1,

These  colourful  and sweet  jewels  from  British  Columbia’s  fields  are little powerhouses  of nutritional  protection.  Of the common  berries,  strawberries  are highest  in vitamin  C, although,  because  of their seeds,  raspberries  contain  a little more  protein  (蛋白质 ), iron and zinc (not that fruits  have  much  protein).  Blueberries  are particularly  high in antioxidants  (抗氧化 物 质 ). The yellow  and orange  stone  fruits  such as peaches  are high in the carotenoids  we turn into vitamin  A and which  are antioxidants.  As for cherries  (樱桃), they are so delicious  who cares?  However,  they are rich in vitamin  C. When  combined  with berries  or slices  of other  fruits,  frozen  bananas  make  an excellent  base for thick,  cooling  fruit shakes  and low fat “ice cream”.  For this purpose,  select  ripe bananas  for freezing  as they are much  sweeter.  Remove  the skin and place  them  in plastic  bags or containers  and freeze.  If you like, a squeeze  of fresh  lemon  juice  on the bananas  will prevent  them  turning  brown.  Frozen  bananas  will last several  weeks,  depending  on their ripeness  and the temperature  of the freezer.  If you have  a juicer , you can simply  feed in frozen  bananas  and some  berries  or sliced  fruit.  Out comes  a “soft-serve”  creamy  dessert,  to be eaten  right  away.  This makes  a fun activity  for a children’s  party;  they love feeding  the fruit and frozen  bananas  into the top of the machine  and watching  the ice cream  come  out below.  24. What  does the author  seem  to like about  cherries?  A. They  contain  protein.     B. They  are high in vitamin  A. C. They  have  a pleasant  taste.    D. They  are rich in antioxidants.  25. Why  is fresh  lemon  juice  used in freezing  bananas?  A. To make  them  smell  better.   B. To keep  their colour.  C. To speed  up their ripening.   D. To improve  their nutrition.  26.

While  the decline  over the past decade  is steep  for teen readers,  some  data in the report  shows  that reading  remains  a big part of many  children’s  lives,  and indicates  how parents  might  help encourage  more  reading.  According  to the report’s  key findings,  “the proportion  (比例 ) who say they ‘hardly  ever’  read for fun has gone  from  8 percent  of 13-year-olds  and 9 percent  of 17-year-olds  in 1984  to 22 percent  and 27 percent  respectively  today.”  The report  data shows  that pleasure  reading  levels  for younger  children,  ages 2-8, remain  largely  the same.  But the amount  of time spent  in reading  each session  has declined,  from  closer  to an hour or more  to closer  to a half hour per session.  When  it comes  to technology  and reading,  the report  does little to counsel  (建议) parents  looking  for data about  the effect  of e-readers  and tablets  on reading.  It does point  out that many  parents  still limit  electronic  reading,  mainly  due to concerns  about  increased  screen  time.  The most  hopeful  data shared  in the report  shows  clear  evidence  of parents  serving  as examples  and important  guides  for their kids when  it comes  to reading.  Data  shows  that kids and teens  who do read frequently,  compared  to infrequent  readers,  have  more  books  in the home,  more  books  purchased  for them,  parents  who read more  often,  and parents  who set aside  time for them  to read.  As the end of school  approaches,  and school  vacation  reading  lists loom  (逼近 ) ahead,  parents  might  take this chance  to step in and make  their own summer  reading  list and plan a family  trip to the library  or bookstore.  28. What  is the Common  Sense  Media  report  probably  about?  A. Children’s  reading  habits.         B. Quality  of children’s  books.  C. Children’s  after-class  activities.     D. Parent-child  relationships.  29. Where  can you find the data that best supports  “children  are reading  a lot less for fun”?  A. In paragraph  2.              B. In paragraph  3. C. In paragraph  4.              D. In paragraph  5. 30. Why  do many  parents  limit  electronic  reading?  A. E-books  are of poor quality.       B. It could  be a waste  of time.  C.

What’s  the problem?  It’s possible  that we all have  compromised  conversational  intelligence.  It’s more  likely  that none  of us start a conversation  because  it’s awkward  and challenging,  or we think  it’s annoying  and unnecessary.  But the next time you find yourself  among  strangers,  consider  that small  talk is worth  the trouble.  Experts  say it’s an invaluable  social  practice  that results  in big benefits.  Dismissing  small  talk as unimportant  is easy,  but we can’t  forget  that deep  relationships  wouldn’t  even  exist  if it weren’t  for casual  conversation.  Small  talk is the grease  (润滑剂 ) for social  communication,  says Bernardo  Carducci,  director  of the Shyness  Research  Institute  at Indiana  University  Southeast.  “Almost  every  great  love story  and each big business  deal begins  with small  talk,”  he explains.  “The  key to successful  small  talk is learning  how to connect  with others,  not just communicate  with them.”  In a 2014  study,  Elizabeth  Dunn,  associate  professor  of psychology  at UBC,  invited  people  on their way into a coffee  shop.  One group  was asked  to seek out an interaction  (互动 ) with its waiter;  the other,  to speak  only when  necessary.  The results  showed  that those  who chatted  with their server  reported  significantly  higher  positive  feelings  and a better  coffee  shop  experience.  “It’s not that talking  to the waiter  is better  than talking  to your husband,”  say Dunn.  “But  interactions  with peripheral  (边缘的 ) members  of our social  network  matter  for our well-being  also.”  Dunn  believes  that people  who reach  out to strangers  feel a significantly  greater  sense  of belonging,  a bond  with others.  Carducci  believes  developing  such a sense  of belonging  starts  with small  talk. “Small  talk is the basis  of good  manners,”  he says.  32. What  phenomenon  is described  in the first paragraph?  A. Addiction  to smartphones.  B. Inappropriate  behaviours  in public  places.  C. Absence  of communication  between  strangers.  D. Impatience  with slow  service.  33. What  is important  for successful  small  talk according  to Carducci?  A. Showing  good  manners.     B. Relating  to other  people.  C. Focusing  on a topic.      D. Making  business  deals.  34. What  does the coffee-shop  study  suggest  about  small  talk?  A. It improves  family  relationships.   B. It raises  people’s  confidence.  C. It matters  as much  as formal  talk.  D. It makes  people  feel good.  35. What  is the best title for the text?  A. Conversation  Counts      B. Ways  of Making  Small  Talk C. Benefits  of Small  Talk     D.

People settle in these places because they are easy to get to and naturally suited to communications and trade. New York City, for example, is near a large harbour at the mouth of the Hudson River. Over 300 years its population grew gradually from 800 people to 8 million. But not all cities develop slowly over a long period of time. Boom towns grow from nothing almost overnight. In 1896, Dawson, Canada, was unmapped wilderness (荒野). But gold was discovered there in 1897, and two years later, it was one of the largest cities in the West, with a population of 30,000.Dawson did not have any of the natural conveniences of cities like London or Paris. People went there for gold. They travelled over snow-covered mountains and sailed hundreds of miles up icy rivers. The path to Dawson was covered with thirty feet of wet snow that could fall without warming. An avalanche(雪崩) once closed the path, killing 63 people. For many who made it to Dawson, however, the rewards were worth the difficult trip. Of the first 20,000 people who dug for gold, 4,000 got rich. About 100 of these stayed rich men for the rest of their lives.But no matter how rich they were, Dawson was never comfortable. Necessities like food and wood were very expensive. But soon, the gold that Dawson depended on had all been found. The city was crowded with disappointed people with no interest in settling down, and when they heard there were new gold discoveries in Alaska, they left Dawson City as quickly as they had come. Today, people still come and go — to see where the Canadian gold rush happened. Tourism is now the chief industry of Dawson City — its present population is 762.24. What attracted the early settlers to New York City?A. Its business culture.            B. Its small population.[来]C. Its geographical position.        D. Its favourable climate.25. What do we know about those who first dug for gold in Dawson?A. Two-thirds of them stayed there.      B. One out of five people got rich.C. Almost everyone gave up.           D. Half of them died.26.

Wang Shu, a 49-year-old Chinese architect, won the 2012 Pritzker Architecture Prize — which is often referred to as the Nobel Prize in architecture — on February 28. He is the first Chinese citizen to win this award.Wang serves as head of the Architecture Department at the China Academy of Art (CAA). His office is located at the Xiangshan campus (校园) of the university in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province. Many buildings on the campus are his original creations.The style of the campus is quite different from that of most Chinese universities. Many visitors were amazed by the complex architectural space and abundant building types. The curves (曲线) of the buildings perfectly match the rise and fall of hills, forming a unique view.Wang collected more than 7 million abandoned bricks of different ages. He asked the workers to use traditional techniques to make the bricks into walls, roofs and corridors. This creation attracted a lot of attention thanks to its mixture of modern and traditional Chinese elements (元素).Wang’s works show a deep understanding of modern architecture and a good knowledge of traditions. Through such a balance, he had created a new type of Chinese architecture, said Tadao Ando, the winner of the 1995 Pritzker Prize.Wang believes traditions should not be sealed in glass boxes at museums. “That is only evidence that traditions once existed,” he said.“Many Chinese people have a misunderstanding of traditions. They think tradition means old things from the past. In fact, tradition also refers to the things that have been developing and that are still being created,” he said.“Today, many Chinese people are learning Western styles and theories rather than focusing on Chinese traditions. Many people tend to talk about traditions without knowing what they really are,” said Wang.学K]The study of traditions should be combined with practice. Otherwise, the recreation of traditions would be artificial and empty, he said.28. Wang’s winning of the prize means that Chinese architects are ___________.A. following the latest world trend       B. getting international recognitionC. working harder than ever before       D. relying on foreign architects29. What impressed visitors to the CAA Xiangshan campus most?A. Its hilly environment. \tB. Its large size.C. Its unique style.\t\t\tD. Its diverse functions.30.

Why do we often assume that more is more when it comes to kids and their belongings? The good news is that I can help my own kids learn earlier than I did how to live more with less. I found the pre-holidays a good time to encourage young children to donate less-used things, and it worked. Because of our efforts, our daughter Georgia did decide to donate a large bag of toys to a little girl whose mother was unable to pay for her holiday due to illness. She chose to sell a few larger objects that were less often used when we promised to put the money into her school fund (基金) (our kindergarten daughter is serious about becoming a doctor).For weeks, I’ve been thinking of bigger, deeper questions: How do we make it a habit for them? And how do we train ourselves to help them live with, need, and use less? Yesterday, I sat with my son, Shepherd, determined to test my own theory on this. I decided to play with him with only one toy for as long as it would keep his interest. I expected that one toy would keep his attention for about five minutes, ten minutes, max. I chose a red rubber ball—simple, universally available. We passed it, he tried to put it in his mouth, he tried bouncing it, rolling it, sitting on it, throwing it. It was totally, completely enough for him. Before I knew it an hour had passed and it was time to move on to lunch.We both became absorbed in the simplicity of playing together. He had my full attention and I had his. My little experiment to find joy in a single object worked for both of us.32. What do the words “more is more” in paragraph 1 probably mean?A. The more, the better.\t\t\t\t\tB. Enough is enough.C. More money, more worries.\t\t\tD. Earn more and spend more.33. What made Georgia agree to sell some of her objects?A. Saving up for her holiday \t\t\t\tB. Raising money for a poor girlC. Adding the money to her fund \t\t\tD. Giving the money to a sick mother34. Why did the author play the ball with Shepherd?A.

The 8-year-old is the joker of the class. With shining dark eyes, he seems like the of kid who would enjoy public speaking.But he’s, nervous.“I’m here to tell you today why you should … should…”Chris trips on the“-ld,”a. pronunciation difficulty for many non-native English speakers. His teacher ,Thomas Whaley ,is next to him, whispering support.“…Vote for …me …”Except for some stumbles, Chris is doing amazingly well. When he brings his speech to a nice conclusion ,Whaley invites the rest of the class to praise him.A son of immigrants, Chris stared learning English a little over three years ago. Whaley recalls(回想起)how at the beginning of the year，when called upon to read，Chris would excuse himself to go to the bathroom.Learning English as a second language can be a painful experience. What you need is a great teacher who lets you make mistakes. “It takes a lot for any student，” Whaley explains，“especially for a student who is learning English as their new language，to feel confident enough to say，‘I don’t know，but I want to know.’”Whaley got the idea of this second-grade presidential campaign project when he asked the children one day to raise their hands if they thought they could never be a president. The answer broke his heart. Whaley says the project is about more than just learning to read and speak in public. He wants these kids to learn to boast(夸耀)about themselves.“Boasting about yourself，and your best qualities,” Whaley says，“is very difficult for a child who came into the classroom not feeling confident.”24. What made Chris nervous？A. Telling a story.\tB. Making a speech.C. Taking a test.\tD. Answering a question.25. What does the underlined word “stumbles” in paragraph 2 refer to?A. Improper pauses.\tB.

At present, these technologies are still expensive, though.Researchers from Georgia Tech say that they have come up with a low-cost device(装置)that gets around this problem: a smart keyboard. This smart keyboard precisely measures the cadence(节奏)with which one types and the pressure fingers apply to each key. The keyboard could offer a strong layer of security by analyzing things like the force of a user's typing and the time between key presses. These patterns are unique to each person. Thus, the keyboard can determine people's identities, and by extension, whether they should be given access to the computer it's connected to—regardless of whether someone gets the password right.It also doesn't require a new type of technology that people aren't already familiar with. Everybody uses a keyboard and everybody types differently.In a study describing the technology, the researchers had 100 volunteers type the word “touch”four times using the smart keyboard. Data collected from the device could be used to recognize different participants based on how they typed, with very low error rates. The researchers say that the keyboard should be pretty straightforward to commercialize and is mostly made of inexpensive, plastic-like parts. The team hopes to make it to market in the near future.28. Why do the researchers develop the smart keyboard?A. To reduce pressure on keys.\tB. To improve accuracy in typingC. To replace the password system.\tD. To cut the cost of e-space protection.29. What makes the invention of the smart keyboard possible？A. Computers are much easier to operate.B.

I was the queen of the playground. Then came my tweens and teens, and mean girls and cool kids. They rose in the ranks not by being friendly but by smoking cigarettes, breaking rules and playing jokes on others, among whom I soon found myself.Popularity is a well-explored subject in social psychology. Mitch Prinstein, a professor of clinical psychology sorts the popular into two categories: the likable and the status seekers. The likables’ plays-well-with-others qualities strengthen schoolyard friendships, jump-start interpersonal skills and, when tapped early, are employed ever after in life and work. Then there’s the kind of popularity that appears in adolescence: status born of power and even dishonorable behavior.Enviable as the cool kids may have seemed, Dr. Prinstein’s studies show unpleasant consequences. Those who were highest in status in high school, as well as those least liked in elementary school, are “most likely to engage(从事)in dangerous and risky behavior.”In one study, Dr. Prinstein examined the two types of popularity in 235 adolescents, scoring the least liked, the most liked and the highest in status based on student surveys(调查研究). “We found that the least well-liked teens had become more aggressive over time toward their classmates. But so had those who were high in status. It clearly showed that while likability can lead to healthy adjustment, high status has just the opposite effect on us."Dr. Prinstein has also found that the qualities that made the neighbors want you on a play date-sharing, kindness, openness — carry over to later years and make you better able to relate and connect with others.In analyzing his and other research，Dr. Prinstein came to another conclusion: Not only is likability related to positive life outcomes, but it is also responsible for those outcomes, too. "Being liked creates opportunities for learning and for new kinds of life experiences that help somebody gain an advantage, ” he said.32.

Here she picks her top reads.MatildaRoald DahlI once wrote a paper on the influence of fairy tales on Roald Dahl\'s writing and it gave me a new appreciation for his strange and delightful words. Matilda\'s battles with her cruel me parents and the bossy headmisres，Miss Trunchbull，are equally fumy and frightening，but they\'re also aspirational.After DarkHaruki MurakamiIt’s about two sisters-Eri，a model who either won’t or can’t stop sleeping，and Mari, a young student . In trying to connect to her sister. Mari starts changing her life and discovers a world of diverse ”night people” who are hiding secrets.Gone GirlGillian FynnThere was a bit of me that didn\'t want to love this when everyone else on the planet did but the horror story is brilliant. There\'s tension and anxiety from the beginning as Nick and Amy battle for your trust. It\'s a real whodunit and the frustration when you realise what\'s going on is horribly enjoyableThe StandStephen KingThis is an excellent fantasy novel from one of the best storytellers around. After a serious flu outbreak wipes out 99.4% of the world\'s population, a battle unfolds between good and evil among those let. Randall Flagg is one of the scariest characters ever.21.

She may just need a little persuading. So I try again and tug at the heartstrings. I mention the single parent with four kids running the show and I talk about the dad coaching a team that his kids aren’t even on … At this point the unwilling parent speaks up,“Alright. Yes, I’ll do it.”I’m secretly relieved because I know there’s real power in sharing volunteer responsibilities among many. The unwilling parent organizes the meal schedule, sends out emails, and collects money for end-of-season gifts. Somewhere along the way, the same parent ends up becoming an invaluable member of the team. The coach is able to focus on the kids while the other parents are relieved to be off the hook for another season. Handing out sliced oranges to bloodthirsty kids can be as exciting as watching your own kid score a goal.Still, most of us volunteers breathe a sigh of relief when the season comes to a close. That relief is coupled with a deep understanding of why the same people keep coming back for more: Connecting to the community(社区)as you freely give your time, money, skills, or services provides a real joy.

What is she reading? None of your business! Lunch is Bechtel’s “me” time. And like more Americans, she’s not alone.A new report found 46 percent of meals are eaten alone in America. More than half(53 percent)have breakfast alone and nearly half(46 percent)have lunch by themselves. Only at dinnertime are we eating together anymore，74 percent，according to statistics from the report.“I prefer to go out and be out. Alone，but together，you know？”Bechtel said，looking up from her book. Bechtel，who works in downtown West Palm Beach，has lunch with coworkers sometimes，but like many of us，too often works through lunch at her desk. A lunchtime escape allows her to keep a boss from tapping her on the shoulder. She returns to work feeling energized. “Today，I just wanted some time to myself，”she said.Just two seats over，Andrew Mazoleny，a local videographer，is finishing his lunch at the bar. He likes that he can sit and check his phone in peace or chat up the barkeeper with whom he's on a first-name basis if he wants to have a little interaction(交流). “I reflect on how my day's gone and think about the rest of the week,” he said. “It's a chance for self-reflection, You return to work recharged and with a plan.”That freedom to choose is one reason more people like to eat alone. There was a time when people may have felt awkward about asking for a table for one，but those days are over. Now，we have our smartphones to keep us company at the table. “It doesn't feel as alone as it may have before al the advances in technology,” said Laurie Demerit， whose company provided the statistics for the report.28.

The microorganisms(微生物) from our bodies grow uncontrollably on surfaces of the International Space Station, so astronauts spend hours cleaning them up each week. How is NASA overcoming this very tiny big problem? It’s turning to a bunch of high school kids. But not just any kids. It depending on NASA HUNCH high school class, like the one science teachers Gene Gordon and Donna Himmelberg lead at Fairport High School in Fairport, New York.HUNCH is designed to connect high school classrooms with NASA engineers. For the past two years, Gordon’s students have been studying ways to kill bacteria in zero gravity, and they think they’re close to a solution(解决方案). “We don’t give the students any breaks. They have to do it just like NASA engineers,” says Florence Gold, a project manager.“There are no tests,” Gordon says. “There is no graded homework. There almost are no grades, other than‘Are you working towards your goal?’ Basically, it’s ‘I’ve got to produce this product and then, at the end of year, present it to NASA.’ Engineers come and really do an in-person review, and…it’s not a very nice thing at time. It’s a hard business review of your product.”Gordon says the HUNCH program has an impact(影响) on college admissions and practical life skills. “These kids are so absorbed in their studies that I just sit back. I don’t teach.” And that annoying bacteria? Gordon says his students are emailing daily with NASA engineers about the problem, readying a workable solution to test in space.32. What do we know about the bacteria in the International Space Station?A. They are hard to get rid of.\tB. They lead to air pollution.C. They appear different forms.\tD. They damage the instruments.33. What is the purpose of the HUNCH program?A. To strengthen teacher-student relationships\tB. To sharpen students’ communication skills.C. To allow students to experience zero gravity.\tD. To link space technology with school education34. What do the NASA engineers do for the students in the program?A. Check their product.\tB. Guide project designsC. Adjust work schedules.\tD. Grade their homework.35. What is the best title for the text?A. NASA: The Home of Astronauts.B. Space: The Final Homework Frontier.C.

The exhibition had record attendance, showing that there is huge interest in Chinese influences."China is impossible to overlook," says Hill. "Chinese models are the faces of beauty and fashion campaigns that sell dreams to women all over the world, which means Chinese women are not just consumers of fashion — they are central to its movement. "Of course, only are today\'s top Western designers being influenced by China-some of the best designers of contemporary fashion are themselves Chinese." Vera Wang, Alexander Wang, Jason Wu are taking on Galiano, Albaz, Marc Jacobs-and beating them hands down in design and sales," adds Hil.For Hill, it is impossible not to talk about China as the leading player when discussing fashion. "The most famous designers are Chinese, so are the models, and so are the consumers," she says. "China is no longer just another market; in many senses it has become the market. If you talk about fashion today, you are talking about China-its influences, its direction, its breathtaking clothes, and how young designers and models are finally acknowledging that in many ways."24. What can we learn about the exhibition in New York?A. It promoted the sales of artworks.\tB. It attracted a large number of visitors.C. It showed ancient Chinese clothes.\tD. It aimed to introduce Chinese models.25. What does Hill say about Chinese women?A. They are setting the fashion.\tB. They start many fashion campaigns.C. They admire super models.\tD.

Today $8 or $10 seems a small amount of money, but at that time these amounts were forbidding to most citizens. Accordingly, newspapers were read almost only by rich people in politics or the trades. In addition, most newspapers had little in them that would appeal to a mass audience. They were dull and visually forbidding. But the revolution that was taking place in the 1830s would change all that.The trend, then, was toward the "penny paper"-a term referring to papers made widely available to the public. It meant any inexpensive newspaper; perhaps more importantly it meant newspapers that could be bought in single copies on the street.This development did not take place overnight. It had been possible(but not easy)to buy single copies of newspapers before 1830,but this usually meant the reader had to go down to the printer\'s office to purchase a copy. Street sales were almost unknown. However, within a few years, street sales of newspapers would be commonplace in eastern cities. At first the price of single copies was seldom a penny-usually two or three cents was charged-and some of the older well-known papers charged five or six cents. But the phrase "penny paper " caught the public\'s fancy, and soon there would be papers that did indeed sell for only a penny.This new trend of newspapers for "the man on the street" did not begin well. Some of the early ventures(企业)were immediate failures. Publishers already in business, people who were owners of successful papers, had little desire to change the tradition. It took a few youthful and daring businessmen to get the ball rolling.28. Which of the following best describes newspapers in America before the 1830s?A. Academic.\tB. Unattractive.\tC.

The researchers then tested how the monkeys combined—or added—the symbols to get the reward.Here\'s how Harvard Medical School scientist Margaret Livingstone, who led the team, described the experiment: In their cages the monkeys were provided with touch screens. On one part of the screen, a symbol would appear, and on the other side two symbols inside a circle were shown. For example, the number 7 would flash on one side of the screen and the other end would have 9 and 8. If the monkeys touched the left side of the screen they would be rewarded with seven drops of water or juice; if they went for the circle, they would be rewarded with the sum of the numbers—17 in this example.After running hundreds of tests, the researchers noted that the monkeys would go for the higher values more than half the time, indicating that they were performing a calculation, not just memorizing the value of each combination.When the team examined the results of the experiment more closely, they noticed that the monkeys tended to underestimate(低估)a sum compared with a single symbol when the two were close in value—sometimes choosing, for example, a 13 over the sum of 8 and 6. The underestimation was systematic: When adding two numbers, the monkeys always paid attention to the larger of the two, and then added only a fraction(小部分)of the smaller number to it."This indicates that there is a certain way quantity is represented in their brains, "Dr. Livingstone says. “But in this experiment what they\'re doing is paying more attention to the big number than the little one.”32. What did the researchers do to the monkeys before testing them?A. They fed them.\tB. They named them.C. They trained them.\tD. They measured them.33. How did the monkeys get their reward in the experiment?A. By drawing a circle.\tB. By touching a screen.C. By watching videos.\tD. By mixing two drinks.34. What did Livingstone\'s team find about the monkeys?A. They could perform basic addition.\tB. They could understand simple words.C. They could memorize numbers easily.\tD.

There’s a welcome familiarity - but also sometimes a slight suspicion that time has changed you both, and thus the relationship. But books don’t change, people do. And that’s what makes the act of rereading so rich and transformative.The beauty of rereading lies in the idea that our bond with the work is based on our present mental register. It’s true, the older I get, the more I feel time has wings. But with reading, it’s all about the present. It’s about the now and what one contributes to the now, because reading is a give and take between author and reader. Each has to pull their own weight.There are three books I reread annually The first, which I take to reading every spring is Emest Hemningway’s A Moveable Feast. Published in 1964, it’s his classic memoir of 1920s Paris. The language is almost intoxicating (令人陶醉的)，an aging writer looking back on an ambitious yet simpler time. Another is Annie Dillard’s Holy the Firm, her poetic 1975 ramble (随笔) about everything and nothing. The third book is Julio Cortazar’s Save Twilight: Selected Poems, because poetry. And because Cortazar.While I tend to buy a lot of books, these three were given to me as gifs, which might add to the meaning I attach to them. But I imagine that, while money is indeed wonderful and necessary, rereading an author’s work is the highest currency a reader can pay them. The best books are the ones that open further as time passes. But remember, it’s you that has to grow and read and reread in order to better understand your friends.24. Why does the author like rereading?A. It evaluates the writer-reader relationship.B. It’s a window to a whole new world.C. It’s a substitute for drinking with a friend.D. It extends the understanding of oneself.25. What do we know about the book A Moveable Feas!?A. It’s a brief account of a trip.B. It’s about Hemingway’s life as a young man.C. It’s a record of a historic event.D. It’s about Hemingway’s friends in Paris.26. What does the underlined word ＂currency＂ in paragraph 4 refer to?A. DebtB. Reward.C. Allowance.D. Face value.27. What can we infer about the author from the text?A. He loves poetry.B. He’s an editor.C. He’s very ambitious.D. He teaches reading.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, best_of=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=-1, min_p=0.0, seed=None, use_beam_search=False, length_penalty=1.0, early_stopping=False, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=512, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None), prompt_token_ids: [151644, 8948, 198, 2610, 525, 264, 10950, 17847, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 872, 198, 56568, 101909, 22574, 101057, 3837, 100638, 31838, 89012, 106367, 14582, 25, 425, 84814, 311, 264, 2311, 498, 3982, 1349, 1657, 3039, 646, 2666, 1075, 20987, 448, 458, 2310, 4238, 13, 2619, 748, 264, 10565, 70440, 481, 714, 1083, 7025, 264, 8112, 37041, 429, 882, 702, 5497, 498, 2176, 11, 323, 8450, 279, 5025, 13, 1988, 6467, 1513, 1405, 2297, 11, 1251, 653, 13, 1597, 429, 748, 1128, 3643, 279, 1160, 315, 435, 485, 2228, 773, 9080, 323, 86335, 11568, 13143, 315, 435, 485, 2228, 15448, 304, 279, 4522, 429, 1039, 10815, 448, 279, 975, 374, 3118, 389, 1039, 3042, 10502, 4161, 13, 1084, 748, 830, 11, 279, 9014, 358, 633, 11, 279, 803, 358, 2666, 882, 702, 26204, 13, 1988, 448, 5290, 11, 432, 748, 678, 911, 279, 3042, 13, 1084, 748, 911, 279, 1431, 323, 1128, 825, 42972, 311, 279, 1431, 11, 1576, 5290, 374, 264, 2968, 323, 1896, 1948, 3150, 323, 6604, 13, 8886, 702, 311, 6815, 862, 1828, 4680, 52307, 525, 2326, 6467, 358, 435, 485, 329, 29071, 576, 1156, 11, 892, 358, 1896, 311, 5290, 1449, 10464, 374, 5748, 477, 32824, 1229, 3117, 748, 362, 14561, 480, 90928, 13, 29014, 304, 220, 16, 24, 21, 19, 11, 432, 748, 806, 11416, 50242, 315, 220, 16, 24, 17, 15, 82, 12095, 13, 576, 4128, 374, 4558, 71715, 1095, 320, 104098, 102350, 102587, 9370, 69515, 276, 28984, 6916, 3330, 1182, 389, 458, 31755, 3602, 34288, 882, 13, 13293, 374, 51989, 422, 66259, 748, 18710, 279, 37625, 11, 1059, 75434, 220, 16, 24, 22, 20, 17823, 891, 320, 99411, 100041, 8, 911, 4297, 323, 4302, 13, 576, 4843, 2311, 374, 80825, 35675, 33044, 748, 10255, 51045, 25, 29302, 13808, 11852, 11, 1576, 31249, 13, 1597, 1576, 35675, 33044, 94286, 358, 8376, 311, 3695, 264, 2696, 315, 6467, 11, 1493, 2326, 1033, 2661, 311, 752, 438, 95913, 11, 892, 2578, 912, 311, 279, 7290, 358, 15498, 311, 1105, 13, 1988, 358, 12793, 429, 11, 1393, 3220, 374, 12824, 11117, 323, 5871, 11, 435, 485, 2228, 458, 3150, 748, 975, 374, 279, 8426, 11413, 264, 6604, 646, 2291, 1105, 13, 576, 1850, 6467, 525, 279, 6174, 429, 1787, 4623, 438, 882, 16211, 13, 1988, 6099, 11, 432, 748, 498, 429, 702, 311, 3063, 323, 1349, 323, 435, 485, 329, 304, 1973, 311, 2664, 3535, 697, 4780, 13, 17, 19, 13, 8429, 1558, 279, 3150, 1075, 435, 485, 2228, 30, 32, 13, 1084, 66249, 279, 6916, 90479, 5025, 1785, 13, 1084, 748, 264, 3241, 311, 264, 4361, 501, 1879, 727, 13, 1084, 748, 264, 27679, 369, 16163, 448, 264, 4238, 909, 13, 1084, 2239, 279, 8660, 315, 56569, 13, 17, 20, 13, 3555, 653, 582, 1414, 911, 279, 2311, 362, 14561, 480, 3841, 300, 57390, 32, 13, 1084, 748, 264, 9814, 2692, 315, 264, 8411, 1785, 13, 1084, 748, 911, 32824, 287, 3117, 748, 2272, 438, 264, 3908, 883, 727, 13, 1084, 748, 264, 3255, 315, 264, 18035, 1538, 909, 13, 1084, 748, 911, 32824, 287, 3117, 748, 4780, 304, 12095, 13, 17, 21, 13, 3555, 1558, 279, 1212, 15121, 3409, 62823, 224, 15973, 145179, 304, 14311, 220, 19, 8300, 311, 30, 32, 13, 57554, 33, 13, 55800, 727, 13, 26530, 681, 909, 13, 18596, 897, 13, 17, 22, 13, 3555, 646, 582, 23583, 911, 279, 3150, 504, 279, 1467, 30, 32, 13, 1260, 15803, 31249, 1785, 13, 1260, 748, 458, 6440, 727, 13, 1260, 748, 1602, 31755, 909, 13, 1260, 32892, 5290, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198], lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

It does, however, have its own problem.Race walkers are conditioned athletes. The longest track and field event at the Summer Olympics is the 50-kilometer race walk, which is about five miles longer than the marathon. But the sport’s rules require that a race walker’s knees stay straight through most of the leg swing and one foot remain in contact (接触) with the ground at all times. It’s this strange form that makes race walking such an attractive activity, however, says Jaclyn Norberg, an assistant professor of exercise science at Salem State University in Salem, Mass.Like running, race walking is physically demanding, she says, According to most calculations, race walkers moving at a pace of six miles per hour would burn about 800 calories(卡路里) per hour, which is approximately twice as many as they would burn walking, although fewer than running, which would probably burn about 1,000 or more calories per hour.However, race walking does not pound the body as much as running does, Dr. Norberg says. According to her research, runners hit the ground with as much as four times their body weight per step, while race walkers, who do not leave the ground, create only about 1.4 times their body weight with each step.As a result, she says, some of the injuries associated with running, such as runner’s knee, are uncommon among race walkers. But the sport’s strange form does place considerable stress on the ankles and hips, so people with a history of such injuries might want to be cautious in adopting the sport. In fact, anyone wishing to try race walking should probably first consult a coach or experienced racer to learn proper technique, she says. It takes some practice.28.

Recent studies have found positive effects. A study conducted in Youngstown，Ohio，for example, discovered that greener areas of the city experienced less crime. In another，employees were shown to be 15% more productive when their workplaces were decorated with houseplants.The engineers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology(MIT)have taken it a step further changing the actual composition of plants in order to get them to perform diverse，even unusual functions. These include plants that have sensors printed onto their leaves to show when they’re short of water and a plant that can detect harmful chemicals in groundwater. ＂We’re thinking about how we can engineer plants to replace functions of the things that we use every day,＂explained Michael Strano, a professor of chemical engineering at MIT.One of his latest projects has been to make plants glow(发光)in experiments using some common vegetables. Strano’s team found that they could create a faint light for three-and-a-half hours. The light，about one-thousandth of the amount needed to read by，is just a start. The technology, Strano said, could one day be used to light the rooms or even to turn tree into self-powered street lamps.in the future，the team hopes to develop a version of the technology that can be sprayed onto plant leaves in a one-off treatment that would last the plant’s lifetime. The engineers are also trying to develop an on and off＂switch＂where the glow would fade when exposed to daylight.Lighting accounts for about 7% of the total electricity consumed in the US. Since lighting is often far removed from the power source(电源)-such as the distance from a power plant to street lamps on a remote highway-a lot of energy is lost during transmission(传输).Glowing plants could reduce this distance and therefore help save energy.32. What is the first paragraph mainly about?A. A new study of different plants.B. A big fall in crime rates.C. Employees from various workplaces.D. Benefits from green plants.33. What is the function of the sensors printed on plant leaves by MIT engineer?A. To detect plants’ lack of waterB. To change compositions of plantsC. To make the life of plants longer.D. To test chemicals in plants.34. What can we expect of the glowing plants in the future?A. They will speed up energy production.B. They may transmit electricity to the home.C.

Puzzle play was found to be a significant predictor of cognition(认知) after controlling for differences in parents’ income, education and the amount of parent talk, Levine said.The researchers analyzed video recordings of 53 child-parent pairs during everyday activities at home and found children who play with puzzles between 26 and 46 months of age have better spatial skills when assessed at 54 months of age.“The children who played with puzzles performed better than those who did not, on tasks that assessed their ability to rotate(旋转)and translate shapes,” Levine said in a statement.The parents were asked to interact with their children as they normally would, and about half of children in the study played with puzzles at one time. Higher-income parents tended to have children play with puzzles more frequently, and both boys and girls who played with puzzles had better spatial skills. However, boys tended to play with more complex puzzles than girls, and the parents of boys provided more spatial language and were more active during puzzle play than parents of girls.The findings were published in the journal Developmental Science.24.

But some ecologists and fashion (时装)enthusiasts are trying to bring back the market for fur made from nutria(海狸鼠).Unusual fashion shows in New Orleans and Brooklyn have showcased nutria fur made into clothes in different styles. “It sounds crazy to talk about guilt-free fur-unless you understand that the nutria are destroying vast wetlands every year”, says Cree McCree, project director of Righteous Fur.Scientists in Louisiana were so concerned that they decided to pay hunters $5 a tail. Some of the fur ends up in the fashion shows like the one in Brooklyn last month.Nutria were brought there from Argentina by fur farmers and let go into the wild. “The ecosystem down there can’t handle this non-native species(物种).It’s destroying the environment. It’s them or us.” says Michael Massimi, an expert in this field.The fur trade kept nutria in check for decades，but when the market for nutria collapsed in the late 1980s，the cat-sized animals multiplied like crazy.Biologist Edmond Mouton runs the nutria control program for Louisiana.

I have for as long as I can remember. I was always an enthusiastic reader, sometimes reading up to three books a day as a child. Stories were like air to me and while other kids played ball or went to parties, I lived out adventures through the books I checked out from the library.My first job was working at the Ukiah Library when I was 16 years old .It was a dream job and I did everything from shelving books to reading to the children for story time.As I grew older and became a mother, the library took on a new place and an added meaning in my life. I had several children and books were our main source(来源) of entertainment. It was a big deal for us to load up and go to the local library, where my kids could pick out books to read or books they wanted me to read to them.I always read ,using different voices ,as though I were acting out the stories with my voice and they loved it !It was a special time to bond with my children and it filled them with the wonderment of books .Now, I see my children taking their children to the library and I love that the excitement of going to the library lives on form generation to generation.As a novelist, I’ve found a new relationship with libraries. I encourage readers to go to their local library when they can’t afford to purchase a book. I see libraries as a safe haven(避风港) for readers and writers, a bridge that helps put together a reader with a book. Libraries, in their own way, help fight book piracy(盗版行为) and 1 think all writers should support libraries in a significant way when they can. Encourage readers to use the library. Share library announcements on your social media. Frequent them and talk about them when you can.32. Which word best describes the author’s relationship with books as a child?A. Cooperative.\tB.

But they weren’t there to throw red paint on fur-coat-wearing film stars. Instead, one activist, dressed in a full-body monkey suit, had arrived with a sign praising the filmmakers: “Thanks for not using real apes (猿)!”The creative team behind “Apes” used motion-capture (动作捕捉) technology to create digitalized animals, spending tens of millions of dollars on technology that records an actor’s performance and later processes it with computer graphics to create a final image (图像). In this case, one of a realistic-looking ape.Yet “Apes” is more exception than the rule. In fact, Hollywood has been hot on live animals lately. One nonprofit organization, which monitors the treatment of animals in filmed entertainment, is keeping tabs on more than 2,000 productions this year. Already, a number of films, including “Water for Elephants,” “The Hangover Part Ⅱ” and “Zookeeper,” have drawn the anger of activists who say the creatures acting in them haven’t been treated properly.In some cases, it’s not so much the treatment of the animals on set in the studio that has activists worried; it’s the off-set training and living conditions that are raising concerns. And there are questions about the films made outside the States, which sometimes are not monitored as closely as productions filmed in the States.24. Why did the animal activists gather on Hollywood Boulevard?A. To see famous film stars.B. To oppose wearing fur coats.C. To raise money for animal protection.D. To express thanks to some filmmakers.25 What does paragraph 2 mainly talk about?A. The cost of making “Apes.”B. The creation of digitalized apes.C. The publicity about “Apes.”D.

They share a front door and a washing machine, but Rita Whitehead has her own kitchen, bathroom, bedroom and living room on the ground floor.“We floated the idea to my mum of sharing at a house,” says Kathryn Whitehead. Rita cuts in: “We spoke more with Nick because I think it’s a big thing for Nick to live with his mother-in-law.”And what does Nick think? “From my standpoint, it all seems to work very well. Would I recommend it? Yes, I think I would.”It’s hard to tell exactly how many people agree with him, but research indicates that the numbers have been rising for some time. Official reports suggest that the number of households with three generations living together had risen from 325,000 in 2001to 419,000 in 2013.Other varieties of multigenerational family are more common. Some people live with their elderly parents; many more adult children are returning to the family home, if they ever left. It is said that about 20% of 25-34-year-olds live with their parents, compared with 16% in 1991.The total number of all multigenerational households in Britain is thought to be about 1.8 million.Stories like that are more common in parts of the world where multigenerational living is more firmly rooted. In India, particularly outside cities, young women are expected to move in with their husband’s family when they get married.28. Who mainly uses the ground floor in the Victorian house in Bristol?A. Nick.\tB. Rita.\tC. Kathryn\tD. The daughters.29. What is Nick’s attitude towards sharing the house with his mother-in -law?A. Positive.\tB. Carefree.\tC. Tolerant.\tD. Unwilling.30. What is the author’s statement about multigenerational family based on?A. Family traditions.\tB. Financial reports.\tC. Published statistics.\tD. Public opinions.31. What is the text mainly about?A.

As scientists look deeper into our genes (基因), they are finding examples of human evolution in just the past few thousand years. People in Ethiopian highlands have adapted to living at high altitudes. Cattle -raising people in East Africa and northern Europe have gained a mutation (突变) that helps them digest milk as adults.On Thursday in an article published in Cell, a team of researchers reported a new kind of adaptation - not to air or to food, but to the ocean. A group of sea-dwelling people in Southeast Asia have evolved into better divers. The Bajau, as these people are known, number in the hundreds of thousands in Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. They have traditionally lived on houseboats; in recent times, they’ve also built houses on stilts (支柱) in coastal waters. “They are simply a stranger to the land,” said Redney C. Jubilado, a University of Hawaii researcher who studies the Bajau.Dr. Jubilado first met the Bajau while growing up on Samal Island in the Philippines. They made a living as divers, spearfishing or harvesting shellfish. “We were so amazed that they could stay underwater much longer than us local islanders,” Dr. Jubilado said. “I could see them actually walking under the sea.”In2015, Melissa Ilardo, then a graduate student in genetics at the University of Copenhagen, heard about the Bajau. She wondered if centuries of diving could have led to the evolution of physical characteristics that made the task easier for them. “it seemed like the perfect chance for natural selection to act on a population,” said Dr. Ilardo. She also said there were likely a number of other genes that help the Bajau dive.32. What does the author want to tell us by the examples in paragraph 1?A. Environmental adaptation of cattle raisers.\tB. New knowledge of human evolution.C. Recent findings of human origin.\tD. Significance of food selection.33. Where do the Bajau build their houses?A. In valleys.\tB. Near rivers.\tC. On the beach.\tD. Off the coast.34. Why was the young Jubilado astonished at the Bajau?A. They could walk on stilts all day.\tB. They had a superb way of fishing.C. They could stay long underwater.\tD. They lived on both land and water.35. What can be a suitable title for the text?A. Bodies Remodeled for a Life at Sea\tB. Highlanders’ Survival SkillsC.

In around 80 A.D., the Romans built the Colosseum, which remains the world’s best known stadium and continues to inform contemporary design. Rome’s Colosseum was 157 feet tall and had 80 entrances, seating 50,000 people. However, that was small fry compared with the city’s Circus Maximus, which accommodated around 250,000 people.These days, safety regulations-not to mention the modern sports fan’s desire for a good view and comfortable seat—tend to keep stadium capacities（容量） slightly lower. Even soccer fans tend to have a seat each; gone are the days of thousands standing to watch the match. For the biggest stadiums in the world, we have used data supplied by the World Atlas list so far, which ranks them by their stated permanent capacity, as well as updated information from official stadium websites. All these stadiums are still funtiona1, still open and still hosting the biggest events in world sport. ·Rungrado 1st of May Stadium, Pyongyang D.P.R. Korea. Capacity: 150,000. Opened: May 1,1989. ·Michigan Stadium, Ann Arbor, Michigan, U. S. Capacity: 107,601. Opened: October 1, 1927. ·Beaver Stadium, State College, Pennsylvania, U. S. Capacity: 106,572.

In fact plenty of younger kids have one in their pocket. Practically everyone can make and receive calls anywhere, anytime. Still, 55 percent of Australians have a landline phone at home and only just over a quarter （29%） rely only on their smartphones according to a survey （调查）. Of those Australians who still have a landline, a third concede that it’s not really necessary and they’re keeping it as a security blanket — 19 percent say they never use it while a further 13 percent keep it in case of emergencies. I think my home falls into that category. More than half of Australian homes are still choosing to stick with their home phone. Age is naturally a factor（因素）— only 58 percent of Generation Ys still use landlines now and then, compared to 84 percent of Baby Boomers who’ve perhaps had the same home number for 50 years. Age isn’t the only factor; I’d say it’s also to do with the makeup of your household. Generation Xers with young families, like my wife and I, can still find it convenient to have a home phone rather than providing a mobile phone for every family member. That said, to be honest the only people who ever ring our home phone are our Baby Boomers parents, to the point where we play a game and guess who is calling before we pick up the phone（using Caller ID would take the fun out of it）. How attached are you to your landline? How long until they go the way of gas street lamps and morning milk deliveries?24. What does paragraph 2 mainly tell us about mobile phones?A. Their target users.\tB. Their wide popularity.C. Their major functions.\tD. Their complex design.25. What does the underlined word “concede” in paragraph 3 mean?A. Admit.\tB. Argue.C. Remember.\tD. Remark.26. What can we say about Baby Boomers?A. They like smartphone games.\tB. They enjoy guessing callers’ identity.C. They keep using landline phones.\tD. They are attached to their family.27. What can be inferred about the landline from the last paragraph?A. It remains a family necessity.B. It will fall out of use some day.C. It may increase daily expenses.D. It is as important as the gas light.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, best_of=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=-1, min_p=0.0, seed=None, use_beam_search=False, length_penalty=1.0, early_stopping=False, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=512, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None), prompt_token_ids: [151644, 8948, 198, 2610, 525, 264, 10950, 17847, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 872, 198, 56568, 101909, 22574, 101057, 3837, 100638, 31838, 89012, 106367, 14582, 25, 425, 4498, 4558, 5019, 702, 264, 6371, 4540, 11, 3170, 525, 803, 1091, 4279, 315, 13369, 10415, 2058, 12515, 369, 264, 4268, 1056, 9909, 99579, 32648, 7552, 30, 9485, 2849, 498, 6925, 387, 2588, 17320, 311, 1477, 5489, 304, 8330, 916, 279, 4231, 315, 220, 16, 20, 879, 3171, 1405, 1828, 264, 6371, 4540, 13, 758, 2097, 11260, 315, 14650, 6837, 614, 825, 304, 862, 17822, 13, 17891, 2673, 5019, 646, 1281, 323, 5258, 6738, 12379, 11, 29094, 13, 16377, 11, 220, 20, 20, 3266, 315, 55837, 614, 264, 4268, 1056, 4540, 518, 2114, 323, 1172, 1101, 916, 264, 8338, 42344, 17, 24, 4, 7552, 17188, 1172, 389, 862, 35022, 4092, 311, 264, 10572, 42344, 101923, 7552, 13, 4940, 1846, 55837, 879, 2058, 614, 264, 4268, 1056, 11, 264, 4843, 80560, 429, 432, 748, 537, 2167, 5871, 323, 807, 3129, 10282, 432, 438, 264, 4763, 38039, 1959, 220, 16, 24, 3266, 1977, 807, 2581, 990, 432, 1393, 264, 4623, 220, 16, 18, 3266, 2506, 432, 304, 1142, 315, 67974, 13, 358, 1744, 847, 2114, 17066, 1119, 429, 5582, 13, 4398, 1091, 4279, 315, 13369, 10415, 525, 2058, 18774, 311, 9214, 448, 862, 2114, 4540, 13, 13081, 374, 17712, 264, 8168, 9909, 100741, 7552, 2293, 1172, 220, 20, 23, 3266, 315, 23470, 809, 82, 2058, 990, 4268, 7969, 1431, 323, 1221, 11, 7707, 311, 220, 23, 19, 3266, 315, 20617, 53411, 388, 879, 3982, 8365, 1030, 279, 1852, 2114, 1372, 369, 220, 20, 15, 1635, 13, 13081, 4436, 1405, 279, 1172, 8168, 26, 358, 6925, 1977, 432, 748, 1083, 311, 653, 448, 279, 26551, 315, 697, 13732, 13, 23470, 1599, 388, 448, 3908, 8521, 11, 1075, 847, 7403, 323, 358, 11, 646, 2058, 1477, 432, 16710, 311, 614, 264, 2114, 4540, 4751, 1091, 8241, 264, 6371, 4540, 369, 1449, 2997, 4462, 13, 2938, 1053, 11, 311, 387, 10745, 279, 1172, 1251, 879, 3512, 10058, 1039, 2114, 4540, 525, 1039, 20617, 53411, 388, 6562, 11, 311, 279, 1459, 1380, 582, 1486, 264, 1809, 323, 7942, 879, 374, 8098, 1573, 582, 3735, 705, 279, 4540, 9909, 970, 56068, 3034, 1035, 1896, 279, 2464, 700, 315, 432, 7552, 13, 2585, 12392, 525, 498, 311, 697, 4268, 1056, 30, 2585, 1293, 3080, 807, 728, 279, 1616, 315, 6819, 8592, 49452, 323, 6556, 14074, 54559, 30, 17, 19, 13, 3555, 1558, 14311, 220, 17, 14576, 3291, 601, 911, 6371, 17619, 30, 32, 13, 10964, 2169, 3847, 13, 12791, 13, 10964, 6884, 22538, 727, 13, 10964, 3598, 5746, 13, 10957, 13, 10964, 6351, 2884, 13, 17, 20, 13, 3555, 1558, 279, 1212, 15121, 3409, 1036, 443, 94874, 854, 304, 14311, 220, 18, 3076, 30, 32, 13, 2410, 1763, 13, 12791, 13, 7638, 361, 727, 13, 19881, 13, 10957, 13, 82733, 13, 17, 21, 13, 3555, 646, 582, 1977, 911, 20617, 53411, 388, 30, 32, 13, 2379, 1075, 21511, 3868, 13, 12791, 13, 2379, 4669, 46476, 81903, 527, 9569, 727, 13, 2379, 2506, 1667, 4268, 1056, 17619, 13, 10957, 13, 2379, 525, 12392, 311, 862, 2997, 13, 17, 22, 13, 3555, 646, 387, 67595, 911, 279, 4268, 1056, 504, 279, 1537, 14311, 30, 32, 13, 1084, 8458, 264, 2997, 31861, 1785, 13, 1084, 686, 4399, 700, 315, 990, 1045, 1899, 727, 13, 1084, 1231, 5263, 7298, 18024, 909, 13, 1084, 374, 438, 2989, 438, 279, 6819, 3100, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198], lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

But does one plastic straw or cup really make a difference? Artist Benjamin Von Wong wants you to know that it does. He builds massive sculptures out of plastic garbage, forcing viewers to re-examine their relationship to single-use plastic products. At the beginning of the year, the artist built a piece called “Strawpocalypse,” a pair of 10-foot-tall plastic waves, frozen mid-crash. Made of 168,000 plastic straws collected from several volunteer beach cleanups, the sculpture made its first appearance at the Estella Place shopping center in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Just 9% of global plastic waste is recycled. Plastic straws are by no means the biggest source（来源）of plastic pollution but they’ve recently come under fire because most people don’t need them to drink with and, because of their small size and weight, they cannot be recycled. Every straw that’s part of Von Wong’s artwork likely came from a drink that someone used for only a few minutes. Once the drink is gone, the straw will take centuries to disappear. In a piece from 2018, Von Wong wanted to illustrate（说明） a specific statistic: Every 60 seconds, a truckload’s worth of plastic enters the ocean. For this work, titled “Truckload of Plastic,” Von Wong and a group of volunteers collected more than 10,000 pieces of plastic, which were then tied together to look like they’d been dumped（倾倒） from a truck all at once. Von Wong hopes that his work will also help pressure big companies to reduce their plastic footprint.28. What are Von Wong’s artworks intended for?A. Beautifying the city he lives in.\tB.

Annoyed by the level of distraction（干扰）in his open office, he said, “That’s why I have a membership at the coworking space across the street — so I can focus”. His comment struck me as strange. After all, coworking spaces also typically use an open office layout（布局）. But I recently came across a study that shows why his approach works. The researchers examined various levels of noise on participants as they completed tests of creative thinking. They were randomly divided into four groups and exposed to various noise levels in the background, from total silence to 50 decibels（分贝）, 70 decibels, and 85 decibels. The differences between most of the groups were statistically insignificant; however, the participants in the 70 decibels group — those exposed to a level of noise similar to background chatter in a coffee shop — significantly outperformed the other groups. Since the effects were small, this may suggest that our creative thinking does not differ that much in response to total silence and 85 decibels of background noise. But since the results at 70 decibels were significant, the study also suggests that the right level of background noise — not too loud and not total silence — may actually improve one’s creative thinking ability. The right level of background noise may interrupt our normal patterns of thinking just enough to allow our imaginations to wander, without making it impossible to focus. This kind of “distracted focus” appears to be the best state for working on creative tasks. So why do so many of us hate our open offices? The problem may be that, in our offices, we can’t stop ourselves from getting drawn into others’ conversations while we’re trying to focus. Indeed, the researchers found that face-to-face interactions and conversations affect the creative process, and yet a coworking space or a coffee shop provides a certain level of noise while also providing freedom from interruptions.32 Why does the interviewer prefer a coworking space?A.

When the tiny creature arrived on January 31, she became the 40th black rhino to be born at the reserve. And officials at Port Lympne were delighted with the new arrival, especially as black rhinos are known for being difficult to breed in captivity (圈养).Paul Beer, head of rhino section at Port Lympne, said: “Obviously we're all absolutely delighted to welcome another calf to our black rhino family. She's healthy, strong and already eager to play and explore. Her mother, Solio, is a first-time mum and she is doing a fantastic job. It's still a little too cold for them to go out into the open, but as soon as the weather warms up, I have no doubt that the little one will be out and about exploring and playing every day.”The adorable female calf is the second black rhino born this year at the reserve, but it is too early to tell if the calves will make good candidates to be returned to protected areas of the wild. The first rhino to be born at Port Lympne arrived on January 5 to first-time mother Kisima and weighed about 32kg. His mother, grandmother and great grandmother were all born at the reserve and still live there.According to the World Wildlife Fund, the global black rhino population has dropped as low as 5500, giving the rhinos a “critically endangered” status.4. Which of the following best describes the breeding programme?A. Costly.\tB. Controversial.\tC. Ambitious.\tD. Successful.5. What does Paul Beer say about the new-born rhino?A. She loves staying with her mother.\tB. She dislikes outdoor activities.C. She is in good condition\tD. She is sensitive to heat.6. What similar experience do Solio and Kisima have?A. They had their first born in January.\tB. They enjoyed exploring new placesC. They lived with their grandmothers.\tD. They were brought to the reserve young7.

Everyone in the family settled quickly into the city except me. Without my beloved beaches and endless blue—sky days, I felt at a loss and out of place. Until I made a discovery.Southbank, at an eastern bend in the Thames, is the center of British skateboarding, where the continuous crashing of skateboards left your head ringing .I loved it. I soon made friends with the local skaters. We spoke our own language. And my favorite: Safe. Safe meant cool. It meant hello. It meant don't worry about it. Once, when trying a certain trick on the beam（横杆）, I fell onto the stones, damaging a nerve in my hand, and Toby came over, helping me up: Safe, man. Safe. A few minutes later, when I landed the trick, my friends beat their boards loud, shouting: “ Safe! Safe! Safe!” And that's what mattered—landing tricks, being a good skater.When I was 15, my family moved to Washington. I tried skateboarding there, but the locals were far less welcoming. Within a couple of years, I'd given it up.When I returned to London in 2004, I found myself wandering down to Southbank, spending hours there. I've traveled back several times since, most recently this past spring. The day was cold but clear: tourists and Londoners stopped to watch the skaters. Weaving（穿梭）among the kids who rushed by on their boards, I found my way to the beam. Then a rail—thin teenager, in a baggy white T—shirt, skidded（滑）up to the beam. He sat next to me. He seemed not to notice the man next to him. But soon I caught a few of his glances. “I was a local here 20 years ago,” I told him. Then, slowly, he began to nod his head. “Safe, man. Safe.”“Yeah,” I said. “Safe.”8. What can we learn about the author soon after he moved to London?A. He felt disappointed.\tB. He gave up his hobby.C. He liked the weather there.\tD.

This question has greatly interested humankind for centuries.Let's state clearly: Einstein was a genius. His face is almost the international symbol for genius. But we want to go beyond one man and explore the nature of genius itself. Why is it that some people are so much more intelligent or creative than the rest of us? And who are they? In the sciences and arts, those praised as geniuses were most often white men, of European origin. Perhaps this is not a surprise. It's said that history is written by the victors, and those victors set the standards for admission to the genius club. When contributions were made by geniuses outside the club—women, or people of a different color or belief—they were unacknowledged and rejected by others.A study recently published by Science found that as young as age six, girls are less likely than boys to say that members of their gender(性别)are “really, really smart.” Even worse, the study found that girls act on that belief: Around age six they start to avoid activities said to be for children who are “really, really smart.” Can our planet afford to have any great thinkers become discouraged and give up? It doesn't take a genius to know the answer: absolutely not.Here's the good news. In a wired world with constant global communication, we're all positioned to see flashes of genius wherever they appear. And the more we look, the more we will see that social factors(因素)like gender, race, and class do not determine the appearance of genius. As a writer says, future geniuses come from those with “intelligence, creativity, perseverance(毅力), and simple good fortune, who are able to change the world.”12. What does the author think of victors' standards for joining the genius club?A. They're unfair.\tB. They're conservative.C. They're objective.\tD. They're strict.13. What can we infer about girls from the study in Science?A. They think themselves smart.B. They look up to great thinkers.C. They see gender differences earlier than boys.D. They are likely to be influenced by social beliefs14 Why are more geniuses known to the public?A. Improved global communication.B. Less discrimination against women.C.

Y.—Dorothy Woodruff and Rosamond Underwood—traveled to a settlement in the Rocky Mountains to teach in a one-room schoolhouse. The girls had gone to Smith College. They wore expensive clothes. So for them to move to Elkhead, Colo. to instruct the children whose shoes were held together with string was a surprise. Their stay in Elkhead is the subject of Nothing Daunted: The Unexpected Education of Two Society Girls in the West by Dorothy Wickenden, who is a magazine editor and Dorothy Woodruff’s granddaughter. Why did they go then? Well, they wanted to do something useful. Soon, however, they realized what they had undertaken.They moved in with a local family, the Harrisons, and, like them, had little privacy, rare baths, and a blanket of snow on their quilt when they woke up in the morning. Some mornings, Rosamond and Dorothy would arrive at the schoolhouse to find the children weeping from the cold. In spring, the snow was replaced by mud over ice. In Wickenden’s book, she expanded on the history of the West and also on feminism, which of course influenced the girls’ decision to go to Elkhead. A hair-raising section concerns the building of the railroads, which entailed (牵涉) drilling through the Rockies, often in blinding snowstorms. The book ends with Rosamond and Dorothy’s return to Auburn.Wickenden is a very good storyteller. The sweep of the land and the stoicism (坚忍) of the people move her to some beautiful writing. Here is a picture of Dorothy Woodruff, on her horse, looking down from a hill top: “When the sun slipped behind the mountains, it shed a rosy glow all around them. Then a full moon rose. The snow was marked only by small animals: foxes, coyotes, mice, and varying hares, which turned white in the winter.” 4. Why did Dorothy and Rosamond go to the Rocky Mountains?A. To teach in a school.\tB. To study American history.C. To write a book.\tD. To do sightseeing.5. What can we learn about the girls from paragraph 3?A. They enjoyed much respect.\tB.

That is the very likely future of applying today’s “eyes in the sky” technology to making sure that the millions of kilometres of rail tracks and infrastructure(基础设施)worldwide are safe for trains on a 24/7 basis. Drones are already being used to examine high-tension electrical lines. They could do precisely the same thing to inspect railway lines and other vital aspects of rail infrastructure such as the correct position of railway tracks and switching points. The more regularly they can be inspected, the more railway safety, reliability and on-time performance will be improved. Costs would be cut and operations would be more efficient(高效)across the board. That includes huge savings in maintenance costs and better protection of railway personnel safety. It is calculated that European railways alone spend approximately 20 billion euros a year on maintenance, including sending maintenance staff, often at night, to inspect and repair the rail infrastructure. That can be dangerous work that could be avoided with drones assisting the crews’ efforts. By using the latest technologies, drones could also start providing higher-value services for railways, detecting faults in the rail or switches, before they can cause any safety problems. To perform these tasks, drones for rail don’t need to be flying overhead. Engineers are now working on a new concept: the rail drones of the future. They will be moving on the track ahead of the train, and programmed to run autonomously. Very small drones with advanced sensors and AI and travelling ahead of the train could guide it like a co-pilot. With their ability to see ahead, they could signal any problem, so that fast-moving trains would be able to react in time.8. What makes the application of drones to rail lines possible?A. The use of drones in checking on power lines.\tB. Drones’ ability to work at high altitudes.C. The reduction of cost in designing drones.\tD. Drones’ reliable performance in remote areas.9. What does “maintenance” underlined in paragraph 3 refer to?A. Personnel safety.\tB. Assistance from drones.C. Inspection and repair.\tD. Construction of infrastructure.10.

First announced in April, 2016, the tax which applies to soft drinks containing more than 5g of sugar per 100ml, was introduced to help reduce childhood obesity（肥胖）. It is believed that today's children and teenagers are consuming three times the recommended level of sugar, putting them at a higher risk of the disease. Initially the sugar tax was expected to make £520m a year for the Treasury. However, data of the first six months showed it would make less than half this amount. At present it is expected to generate £240m for the year ending in April 2019, which will go to school sports. It comes after more than half of soft drinks sold in shops have had their sugar levels cut by manufacturers（制造商）so they can avoid paying the tax. Drinks now contain 45 million fewer kilos of sugar as a result of manufacturers' efforts to avoid the charge, according to Treasury figures. Since April drinks companies have been forced to pay between 18p and 24p for every litre of sugary drink they produce or import, depending on the sugar content. However, some high sugar brands, like Classic Coca Cola, have accepted the sugar tax and are refusing to change for fear of upsetting consumers. Fruit juices, milk-based drinks and most alcoholic drinks are free of the tax, as are small companies manufacturing fewer than 1m litres per year. Today's figures, according to one government official, show the positive influence the sugar tax is having by raising millions of pounds for sports facilities（设施）and healthier eating in schools. Helping the next generation to have a healthy and active childhood is of great importance, and the industry is playing its part. 12. Why was the sugar tax introduced?A. To collect money for schools.\tB. To improve the quality of drinks.C. To protect children’s health.\tD. To encourage research in education.13. How did some drinks companies respond to the sugar tax?A. They turned to overseas markets.\tB. They raised the prices of their products.C. They cut down on their production.\tD. They reduced their products’ sugar content.14. From which of the following is the sugar tax collected?A. Most alcoholic drinks.\tB. Milk-based drinks.\tC. Fruit juices.\tD. Classic Coke.15. What can be inferred about the adoption of the sugar tax policy?A. It is a short-sighted decision.\tB. It is a success story.C. It benefits manufacturers.\tD.

Though not known to use tools in the wild, the birds have proved skilful at tool use while kept in the cage. In a recent experiment, cockatoos were presented with a box with a nut inside it. The clear front of the box had a “keyhole” in a geometric shape, and the birds were given five differently shaped “keys” to choose from. Inserting the correct “key” would let out the nut.In humans, babies can put a round shape in a round hole from around one year of age, but it will be another year before they are able to do the same with less symmetrical (对称的) shapes. This ability to recognize that a shape will need to be turned in a specific direction before it will fit is called an “allocentric frame of reference”. In the experiment, Goffin’s cockatoos were able to select the right tool for the job, in most cases, by visual recognition alone. Where trial-and-error was used, the cockatoos did better than monkeys in similar tests. This indicates that Goffin’s cockatoos do indeed possess an allocentric frame of reference when moving objects in space, similar to two-year-old babies.The next step, according to the researchers, is to try and work out whether the cockatoos rely entirely on visual clues (线索), or also use a sense of touch in making their shape selections.4. How did the cockatoos get the nut from the box in the experiment?A. By following instructions.\tB. By using a tool.C. By turning the box around.\tD. By removing the lid.5. Which task can human one-year-olds most likely complete according to the text?A. Using a key to unlock a door.\tB. Telling parrots from other birds.C. Putting a ball into a round hole.\tD. Grouping toys of different shapes.6. What does the follow-up test aim to find out about the cockatoos?A. How far they are able to see.\tB. How they track moving objects.C. Whether they are smarter than monkeys.\tD. Whether they use a sense of touch in the test.7. Which can be a suitable title for the text?A. Cockatoos: Quick Error Checkers\tB. Cockatoos: Independent LearnersC. Cockatoos: Clever Signal-Readers\tD.

These gentle, lovely gatekeepers welcomed her and kick-started what was to be a trip Ginni would never forget.Ever since her childhood, Ginni, now 71, has had a deep love for travel. Throughout her career(职业) as a professional dancer, she toured in the UK, but always longed to explore further When she retired from dancing and her sons eventually flew the nest, she decided it was time to take the plunge.After taking a degree at Chichester University in Related Arts, Ginni began to travel the world, eventually getting work teaching English in Japan and Chile. And it was in Chile she discovered she could get last-minute cheap deals on ships going to Antarctica from the islands off Tierra del Fuego, the southernmost tip of the South American mainland. “I just decided wanted to go,” she says. “I had no idea about what I’d find there and I wasn’t nervous, I just wanted to do it. And I wanted to do it alone as I always prefer it that way.”In March 2008, Ginni boarded a ship with 48 passengers she’d never met before, to begin the journey towards Antarctica. “From seeing the wildlife to witnessing sunrises, the whole experience was amazing. Antarctica left an impression on me that no other place has,” Ginni says. “I remember the first time I saw a humpback whale; it just rose out of the water like some prehistoric creature and I thought it was smiling at us. You could still hear the operatic sounds it was making underwater.”The realization that this is a precious land, to be respected by humans, was one of the biggest things that hit home to Ginni.8. Which of the following best explains “take the plunge” underlined in paragraph 2?A. Try challenging things.\tB. Take a degree.C. Bring back lost memories.\tD. Stick to a promise.9. What made Ginni decide on the trip to Antarctica?A. Lovely penguins.\tB. Beautiful scenery.C. A discount fare.\tD. A friend’s invitation.10.

The city discovered its harbor. Then, one after another, Sydney discovered lots of things that were just sort of there — broad parks, superb beaches, and a culturally diverse population. But it is the harbor that makes the city.Andrew Reynolds, a cheerful fellow in his early 30s, pilots Sydney ferryboats for a living. I spent the whole morning shuttling back and forth across the harbor. After our third run Andrew shut down the engine, and we went our separate ways — he for a lunch break, I to explore the city.“I’ll miss these old boats,” he said as we parted.“How do you mean?” I asked.“Oh, they’re replacing them with catamarans. Catamarans are faster, but they’re not so elegant, and they’re not fun to pilot. But that’s progress, I guess.”Everywhere in Sydney these days, change and progress are the watchwords (口号), and traditions are increasingly rare. Shirley Fitzgerald, the city’s official historian, told me that in its rush to modernity in the 1970s, Sydney swept aside much of its past, including many of its finest buildings. “Sydney is confused about itself,” she said. “We can’t seem to make up our minds whether we want a modern city or a traditional one. It’s a conflict that we aren’t getting any better at resolving (解决).”On the other hand, being young and old at the same time has its attractions. I considered this when I met a thoughtful young businessman named Anthony. “Many people say that we lack culture in this country,” he told me. “What people forget is that the Italians, when they came to Australia, brought 2000 years of their culture, the Greeks some 3000 years, and the Chinese more still. We’ve got a foundation built on ancient cultures but with a drive and dynamism of a young country. It’s a pretty hard combination to beat.”He is right, but I can’t help wishing they would keep those old ferries.12. What is the first paragraph mainly about?A. Sydney’s striking architecture.\tB.

We can see there  is a lot of sleeping  on the bus or train on the\u3000 21  \u3000home  from  work  in the evenings . A man will be\u3000 22  the newspaper , and seconds  later it \u3000 23  \u3000as if he is trying  to\u3000 24  \u3000it. Or he will fall asleep  on the shoulder  of the stranger\u300025   \u3000 next to him. \u3000 26   place  where  unplanned  short  sleep  \u3000 27  \u3000 is in the lecture  hall where  a student  will start snoring（打鼾） so\u3000 28  that the professor  has to ask another  student  to\u3000 29  \u3000 the sleeper  awake . A more  embarrassing （尴尬）situation  occurs  when  a student  starts  falling  into sleep  and the\u3000 30  \u3000 of the head  pushes  the arm off the\u3000 31  \u3000, and the movement  carries  the\u3000 32  \u3000of the body  along . The student  wakes  up on the floor  with no\u3000 33   of getting  there . The worst  time to fall asleep  is when\u3000 34  . Police  reports  are full of \u3000 35  \u3000that occur  when  people  fall into sleep  and go 36    the road. If the drivers  are\u3000 37  , they are not seriously  hurt. One woman ’s car, \u3000 38  \u3000, went  into the river . She woke  up in four feet of \u3000 39  \u3000and thought  it was raining . When  people  are really\u3000 40  , nothing  will stop them  from  falling  asleep ---no matter  where  they are. 21. A. way B. track  C. path D. road 22.

It speaks    36   than words.  According  to specialists,  our bodies  send out more    37   than we realize.  In fact, non-verbal  (非言语 ) communication  takes  up about  50% of what  we really    38  . And body  language  is particularly    39   when  we attempt  to communicate  across  cultures.  Indeed,  what  is called  body  language  is so   40   a part of us that it’s actually  often  unnoticed.  And misunderstandings  occur  as a result  of it.   41  , different  societies  treat the   42   between  people  differently.  Northern  Europeans  usually  do not like having    43   contact  (接触 ) even  with friends,  and certainly  not with   44  . People  from  Latin  American  countries,    45  , touch  each other  quite  a lot. Therefore,  it’s possible  that in   46  , it may look like a Latino  is   47   a   Norwegian  all over the room.

The Norwegian,  very probably  seeing  this as pushiness,  will keep    49   — which  the Latino  will in return  regard  as   50  . Clearly,  a great  deal is going  on when  people    51  . And only a part of it is in the words  themselves.  And when  parties  are from    52   cultures,  there ’s a strong  possibility  of   53  .

We were  asked  to “  37   a disability”  for several  hours  one Sunday.  Some  member    38   chose  the wheel  chair.  Other  wore  sound-blocking  earplugs  (耳塞 ) or blindfolds  (眼罩 ). Just sitting  in the wheelchair  was a   39   experience,  I had never  considered  before  how   40   it would  be to use one. As soon  as I sat down  my   41   made  the chair  begin  to roll. Its wheel  were  not   42  . Then  I wondered  where  to put my   43  . It took me quite  a while  to get the metal  footrest  into   44  , I took my first uneasy  look at what  was to be my only means  of   45   for several  hours.  For   disabled  people,  “adopting  a wheelchair”  is not a temporary  (临时的 )   46  . I tried to find a   47   position  and thought  it might  be restful,    48   kind of nice to be   49   around  for a while.  Looking  around,  I   50   would  have  to handle  the thing  myself ! My hands  started  to ache as I   51   the heavy  wheels,  I came  to know  that controlling  the   52   of the wheelchair  as not going  to be   53   task. My wheelchair  experiment  was soon    54  . It made  a deep  impression  on me. A few hours  of “disability”  gave  me only a taste of the   55  , both physical  and mental,  that disabled  people  must  overcome.  36.

But their  44   soon  wears  off and by January  those   45   toys can be found  put away  in the basement . The world  is full of \u300046   stamp  albums  and unfinished  models , each standing  as a monument  to someone ’s\u3000 47   interest . When  parents  bring  home  a pet, their child\u300048   bathes  it and brushes  its fur. Within  a short  time, however , the\u3000 49   of caring  for the animal  is handed  over to the parents .

On the way,  we spotted  a man holding  a piece  of paper  that said, “   41    my job. Family  to Feed. ”  At this store, a    42    like this is not normal . My 10-year-old  noticed  him and made  a    43    on how bad it must  be to have  to stand     44    in the cold wind.   In the store , I asked  each  of my kids to    45    something  they thought  our “friend ” there  would     46   . They  got apples,  a sandwich  and a bottle  of juice.  Then  my 17-year-old  suggested  giving  him a    47   . I thought  about  it. We were     48    on cash ourselves , but… well, sometimes     49    from  our need  instead  of our abundance  is    50    what  we need  to do! All the kids    51    something  they could  do away  with for the week.   When  we handed  him the bag of    52   , he lit up and thanked  us with    53    eyes.  When  I handed  him the gift card,  saying  he could  use it for    54    his family  might  need,  he burst  into tears.   This has been  a wonderful     55    for our family.  For days the kids have  been  looking  for others  we can    56   ! Things  would  have  played  out so    57    if   I had simply  said, “No, we really  don’t  have     58    to give more. ” Stepping  out not only helped  a brother  in    59   , it also gave  my kids the    60    taste of helping  others.  It’ll go a long way with them.   41. A. Lost   B. Changed    C. Quit    D. Finished   42. A condition    B. place    C. sight     D. show   43.

This led to some  ___46___  experiences  on Saturday  as they played  against  teams  ___47___  trained.  Through  the first two games,  her ___48___did  not get on serious  shot on goal.

The lessons  they may not be ___60___  what  they would  have  gotten  in school.  But are certainly  more  personal  and meaningful,  because  they had to work  them  out on their own.  41.

They  told her to stay   52   until the emergency  personnel  arrived,    53   she thought  the car was going  to   54  . Larry  told her that he had already  put out the fire and she should  not move    55   she injured  her neck.  Once  fire and emergency  people  arrived,  Larry  and the other  man   56   and let them  go to work.  Then,  Larry  asked  the   57   if he was needed  or   58   to   go. They  let him and the other  man go. One thing  is   59  —Larry  went  above  and beyond  the call of duty by getting  so close  to the burning  vehicle!

And they’ve  never  actually    41   you. Everything  they know  about  you   42   through  this device,  sometimes  from  hundreds  of miles  away.    43   they feel they can know  you   44   from  the sound  of your voice.  That’s  how powerful  the   45   is.  Powerful,  yes, but not always    46  . For years  I dealt  with my travel  agent  only by phone.  Rani,  my faceless  agent  whom  I’d never  met   47  , got me rock-bottom  prices  on airfares,  cars, and hotels.  But her cold voice  really    48   me. I sometimes  wished  to   49   another  agent.  One morning,  I had to   50   an immediate  flight  home  for a family  emergency.  I ran into Rani’s  office    51  . The woman  sitting  at the desk,    52   my madness,  sympathetically  jumped  up. She gave  me a   53   smile,  nodded  while  listening  patiently,  and then printed  out the   54   immediately.  “What  a wonderful  lady!”  I thought.  Rushing  out   55   I called  out over my shoulder,  “By the way,  what’s  your name?”  “I’m  Rani,”  she said. I turned  around  and saw a   56   woman  with a big smile  on her face waving  to wish  me a safe trip. I was   57  ! Why  had I thought    she was cold?  Rani  was, well,  so   58  . Sitting  back  in the car on the way to the airport,  I figured  it all out. Rani’s    59   ― her warm  smile,  her nods,  her ‘I’m here for you’   60   ― were  all silent  signals  that didn’t  travel  through  wires.  41. A. accepted    B. noticed    C. heard     D. met 42.

I was right to have   59   him. From that day on，I grew   60   and a little more real.41. A. cheering for   B. beating out     \tC. relying on      \tD. staying with42.

I myself  went  through  this  41  process  and found  something  that has changed  my  42  at college  for the better:  I discovered  ASL- --American  Sign Language  (美式手语 ). I never  felt an urge to  43  any sign language  before.  My entire  family  is hearing,  and so are all my friends.  The  44   languages  were  enough  in all my interactions  (交往 ). Little  did I know  that I would  discover  my  45    for ASL.  The   46    began  during  my first week  at college.  I watched  as the ASL  Club     47    their translation  of a song.  Both  the hand  movements  and the very   48    of communicating  without  speaking    49  me. What  I saw was completely  unlike  anything  I had experienced  in the   50   . This newness  just left me   51   more.  After  that, feeling  the need  to   52   further,  I decided  to drop in on one of ASL  club’s meetings.  I only learned  how to   53   the alphabet  that day. Yet instead  of being  discouraged  by my   54   progress,  I was excited.  I then made  it a point  to   55   those  meetings  and learn  all I could.  The following  term,  I   56   an ASL  class.  The professor  was deaf and any talking  was   57   . I soon  realized  that the silence  was not unpleasant.    58   , if there  had been  any talking,  it would  have    59   us to learn  less. Now,  I appreciate  the silence  and the   60   way of communication  it opens.  41. A. searching  B. planning  C. natural  D. formal  42. A. progress  B. experience  C. major  D. opinion  43.

Each  day, 27 kids  41  “The  Thinking  Laboratory.”  That was the   42   students  voted  for after deciding  that “Room  104”  was too   43   . Freddy  was an average    44  , but not an average  person.  He had the rare balance  of fun and compassion （同情） . He would     45    the loudest  over fun and be the saddest  over anyone’s    46    . Before  the school  year    47    , I gave  the kids a special     48    , T-shirts  with the words  “Verbs  Are Your    49   ” on them.  I had advised  the kids that while  verbs（动词） may seem  dull, most  of the  50    things  they do throughout  their lives  will be verbs.  Through  the years,  I’d run into former  students  who would  provide     51    on old classmates.  I learned  that Freddy  did several  jobs after his   52    from  high school  and remained  the same   53    person  I met forty  years  before.  Once,  while  working  overnight  at a store,  he let a homeless  man   54   in his truck.  Another  time,  he   55   a friend  money  to buy a house  . Just last year,  I was  56  a workshop  when  someone  knocked  at the classroom  door.  A woman   57  the interruption  and handed  me an envelope.  I stopped  teaching  and   58   it up. Inside  were  the “Verbs”  shirt and a   59   from  Freddy’s  mother.  “Freddy  passed  away  on Thanksgiving.  He wanted  you to have  this.”  I told the story  to the class.  As sad as it was, I couldn’t  help smiling.  Although  Freddy  was taken  from  us, we all   60   something  from  Freddy.    41. A. built  B. entered  C. decorated  D. ran 42.

In his introduction,  he made  it  49  that our credits  would  be hard-earned.  In order  to   50  the class,  among  other  criteria,  we had to write  a paper  on how we plan to 51 what  we would  learn  in class  to our future  professions  and,   52  , to our lives.  I managed  to get an A in that   53  and learned  life lessons  that have  served  me well beyond  the  54  . Ten years  after my chess  class  with Ashley,  I’m still putting  to use what  he 55 me: “The  absolute  most  important   56  that you learn  when  you play chess  is how to make  good   57  . On every  single  move  you have  to  58  a situation,  process  what  your opponent  (对手 ) is doing  and 59   the best move  from  among  all your options.”  These  words  still ring true today  in my   60  as a journalist.  41.

He’d  moved  to England  with his mum  when  he was three  and it had been  13 years  since  I’d  41   seen him. So imagine  my   42   when  he emailed  me saying  he wanted  to come  to visit me. I was   43  ! I arrived  early  at Byron  Bay where  we were  supposed  to   44  . The bay was   45   in sunshine,  and there  was a group  of kayakers  around  150m  off the shore.  Getting  a little   46  , I realized  one kayak  (皮划艇 ) was in   47  . “Something’s  not   48  !” I took off my T-shirt  and   49   into the water.  I saw there  were  two instructors  on board  and a man lying  across  the middle.  He was   50   violently.  Linking  arms  with one of the instructors ，I helped    51   the young  man out of the water.  He was unconscious  and as I looked  at his face,  something    52   to me. Those  brown  eyes were  very   53  . “What’s  his name?”  I asked  the instructor.  “Ben,”  he replied,  and immediately  I   54  . That stranger  was my son! The instructors  called  for an ambulance.    55  , after a brief  stay in hospital,  Ben was well enough  to be allowed  to   56   and later the family  met up for dinner.  We chatted  about  everything  and then Ben   57   to me. “I just want  to say thank  you,”  he said. “You    58   my life!”  I still can’t  believe  what  a   59   it was. I’m just so glad I was there    60   to help my son.  41. A. also    B. often     C. even     D. last 42. A. delight    B. relief        C. anger    D. worry  43.

The ___41___ is obvious. If we ___42___ it is a door, they’ll want to go outside ___43___. It will drive us crazy. The kids apparently know the ___44___. But our insisting it’s ___45___ a window has kept them from ___46___ millions of requests to open the door.I hate lying to the kids. One day they’ll ___47___ and discover that everything they’ve always known about windows is a ___48___.I wonder if ___49___ should always tell the truth no matter the _____50_____. I have a very strong   _____51_____ that the lie we’re telling is doing _____52_____ damage to our children. Windows and doors have _____53_____ metaphorical(比喻) meanings. I’m telling them they can’t open what they absolutely know is a door. What if later in _____54_____ they come to a metaphorical door, like an opportunity(机会) of some sort, and _____55_____ opening the door and taking the opportunity, they just _____56_____ it and wonder, ＂What if it isn’t a door?＂ That is, ＂What if it isn’t a _____57_____ opportunity?＂Maybe it’s an unreasonable fear. But the _____58_____ is that I shouldn’t lie to my kids. I should just _____59_____ repeatedly having to say, ＂No. We can’t go outside now.＂ Then when they come to other doors in life, be they real or metaphorical, they won’t _____60_____ to open them and walk through.41.

I was considering this while working as a ___41___ just a few weeks ago. And it came to me then how much easier it would be if we had a range of words that express different ___42___ of gratitude(感谢). My thoughts were soon ___43___. We had a woman patient who was ___44___ from a knee replacement operation. One afternoon, while ___45___ to get into bed she collapsed(倒下) from what was ___46___ discovered to be a heart attack. The collapse was disastrous, ___47___the emergency medical team and good teamwork. But she recovered, though ___48___, and was ready for discharge(出院)after four weeks.  She was ___49___ for everything that the medical and nursing team had done for her. On her day of discharge, we shared in her _____50_____ at her recovery. As she was _____51_____ she was eager to say _____52_____ to each of us in the nursing team. When she _____53_____ one nurse, she tried to press a five-pound note into her hand. My colleague _____54_____ to accept it, saying that we were all just _____55_____ our job. The patient looked puzzled, and then _____56_____:“Oh this isn't for the_____57_____ I had. I take that as a _____58_____. No, this is for setting my hair yesterday.”    And there you have it.

For them, there’s something highly exciting about ___21___ someone else’s glance and making oneself unable to be seen. However, we all witness that preschool children are remarkably ___22___ at hiding. They often cover only their eyes with their hands, leaving the rest of their bodies ___23___ .For a long time, this ineffective hiding method was ___24___ as evidence that children are hopelessly “egocentric” (自我中心的) creatures. But our ___25___ research results in child developmental psychology ___26___ that idea. We brought young children aged 2-4 into our Minds in Development Lab at USC. Each ___27___ sat down with an adult who covered her own eyes or ___28___ . We then asked the child if she could ___29___ or hear the adult. Surprisingly, children replied that they couldn’t. The same ___30___ happened when the adult covered her own mouth: ___31___ children said that they couldn’t ___32___ to her. A number of ___33___ ruled out that the children misunderstood what they were being asked. The results were clear: Our young subjects ___34___ the questions and knew ___35___ what was asked of them. Their ___36___ to the questions reflected their true ___37___ that “I can see you only if you can see me, too.” They simply ___38___ mutual (相互的) recognition and regard. Our ___39___ suggest when a child “hides” by putting a blanket over her head, it is not a result of egocentrism. In fact, children consider this method ___40___ when others use it.21.

Since  then --- for all these  year --- we had been  allowing  tomatoes  to self-seed where  they please . As result , the plants  are growing  somewhere .

There  are all kinds  of the flowers  and trees  around  the classroom  buildings.  We can lie on the grass  for a rest, or sat by the lake listening  music.

It was very crowded.  Tony  saw a toy on a shop  window.  He liked  it so very much  that he quickly  walked  into the shop.  After  looks  at the toy for some  time,  he turned  around  and found  where  his parents  were  missing.  Tony  was scared  and begun  to cry. A woman  saw him crying  and telling  him to wait outside  a shop.  Five minutes  later,  Tony  saw parents.  Mom  said, “How  nice to see you again!  Dad and I were  terrible  worried.”  Tony  promised  her that this would  never  happen  again.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, best_of=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=-1, min_p=0.0, seed=None, use_beam_search=False, length_penalty=1.0, early_stopping=False, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=512, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None), prompt_token_ids: [151644, 8948, 198, 2610, 525, 264, 10950, 17847, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 872, 198, 56568, 101909, 22574, 101057, 3837, 100638, 31838, 89012, 106367, 14582, 25, 10236, 253, 255, 16744, 22418, 28726, 9909, 34369, 109, 16, 15, 30709, 33872, 3837, 73157, 30709, 33872, 220, 16, 17177, 3837, 115109, 220, 16, 15, 17177, 7552, 220, 4891, 223, 229, 22382, 104105, 99504, 17447, 101049, 101882, 40916, 100299, 101920, 106198, 25177, 104745, 41175, 112720, 25177, 56568, 40916, 100299, 107548, 87752, 19403, 220, 53040, 1773, 104745, 102771, 18830, 220, 16, 15, 44290, 102064, 32100, 3837, 73157, 99700, 15946, 102538, 18830, 77540, 44290, 1773, 73157, 44290, 32100, 99373, 102031, 46944, 110011, 9370, 100649, 5373, 28606, 57191, 25177, 1773, 220, 4891, 95, 252, 20929, 5122, 18493, 99545, 99689, 44290, 20929, 46944, 100515, 44729, 108872, 9909, 73978, 7552, 104931, 41146, 100431, 112672, 75882, 20929, 9370, 99689, 1773, 220, 63073, 5122, 18493, 28726, 9370, 99689, 16872, 99492, 14777, 101209, 43268, 90395, 18493, 75882, 99689, 100431, 112672, 25177, 104813, 99689, 1773, 220, 97161, 5122, 220, 16, 13, 73157, 44290, 32100, 104204, 25177, 99472, 99373, 47149, 14777, 99689, 24968, 220, 220, 17, 13, 91680, 102496, 25177, 220, 16, 15, 44290, 3837, 42140, 28946, 9909, 220, 45181, 29437, 220, 16, 16, 44290, 71618, 7552, 16530, 37643, 17177, 1773, 220, 3776, 1899, 11, 2632, 18528, 220, 3937, 220, 311, 264, 11919, 220, 4126, 220, 448, 806, 2681, 13, 220, 1084, 572, 1602, 38213, 13, 220, 18528, 220, 5485, 264, 21357, 389, 264, 8061, 220, 3241, 13, 220, 1260, 14915, 220, 432, 773, 1602, 1753, 220, 429, 566, 6157, 220, 14858, 220, 1119, 279, 8061, 13, 220, 4636, 220, 5868, 220, 518, 279, 21357, 369, 1045, 220, 882, 11, 220, 566, 6519, 220, 2163, 220, 323, 1730, 220, 1380, 220, 806, 6562, 220, 1033, 220, 7402, 13, 220, 18528, 220, 572, 26115, 220, 323, 21376, 220, 311, 15729, 13, 362, 5220, 220, 5485, 1435, 30199, 220, 323, 11629, 220, 1435, 311, 3783, 4889, 220, 264, 8061, 13, 220, 20924, 4420, 220, 2937, 11, 220, 18528, 220, 5485, 6562, 13, 220, 22180, 220, 1053, 11, 1036, 4340, 220, 6419, 311, 1490, 498, 1549, 0, 220, 32521, 323, 358, 1033, 220, 17478, 220, 17811, 1987, 220, 18528, 220, 18951, 220, 1059, 429, 419, 1035, 220, 2581, 220, 3537, 220, 1549, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198], lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Though  not very big, but the restaurant  is popular  in our area.  It is always  crowded  with customers  at meal  times.  Some  people  even  had to wait outside.  My uncle  tells me that the key to his success  is honest.  Every  day he makes  sure that fresh  vegetables  or high quality  oil   are using  for cooking.

Instead,  he hopes  that our business  will grow  steady.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, best_of=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=-1, min_p=0.0, seed=None, use_beam_search=False, length_penalty=1.0, early_stopping=False, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=512, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None), prompt_token_ids: [151644, 8948, 198, 2610, 525, 264, 10950, 17847, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 872, 198, 56568, 101909, 22574, 101057, 3837, 100638, 31838, 89012, 106367, 14582, 25, 10236, 253, 255, 16744, 22418, 28726, 9909, 34369, 109, 16, 15, 30709, 33872, 24968, 73157, 30709, 33872, 220, 16, 17177, 3837, 115109, 220, 16, 15, 17177, 7552, 220, 4891, 223, 229, 22382, 104105, 99504, 17447, 101049, 101882, 40916, 100299, 101920, 106198, 25177, 104745, 41175, 112720, 25177, 56568, 40916, 100299, 107548, 87752, 104745, 1773, 16744, 102771, 18830, 220, 16, 15, 44290, 102064, 32100, 3837, 73157, 99700, 15946, 102538, 18830, 77540, 44290, 1773, 73157, 44290, 32100, 99373, 102031, 46944, 110011, 9370, 100649, 5373, 28606, 57191, 25177, 1773, 220, 4891, 95, 252, 20929, 5122, 18493, 99545, 99689, 44290, 20929, 46944, 100515, 48391, 17992, 9909, 73978, 48272, 104931, 41146, 100431, 112672, 75882, 20929, 9370, 99689, 1773, 220, 63073, 5122, 99360, 115917, 99689, 11622, 102669, 43268, 9909, 1124, 7552, 99492, 100373, 1773, 220, 63071, 5122, 18493, 28726, 9370, 99689, 16872, 99492, 14777, 101209, 43268, 90395, 18493, 75882, 99689, 100431, 112672, 25177, 104813, 99689, 1773, 220, 97161, 5122, 220, 16, 13, 6567, 107, 237, 44290, 32100, 104204, 25177, 99472, 99373, 47149, 14777, 99689, 24968, 220, 220, 17, 13, 26853, 103, 102496, 25177, 220, 16, 15, 44290, 3837, 42140, 28946, 9909, 220, 45181, 29437, 220, 16, 16, 44290, 71618, 7552, 16530, 37643, 17177, 1773, 220, 3017, 37494, 220, 374, 279, 6372, 220, 315, 264, 10729, 220, 3265, 220, 311, 429, 358, 3887, 13, 17594, 220, 537, 1602, 2409, 11, 714, 279, 10729, 220, 374, 5411, 220, 304, 1039, 3082, 13, 220, 1084, 374, 2677, 220, 38213, 220, 448, 6310, 220, 518, 15145, 220, 3039, 13, 220, 4329, 220, 1251, 220, 1496, 220, 1030, 311, 3783, 4889, 13, 220, 3017, 37494, 220, 10742, 752, 429, 279, 1376, 311, 806, 2393, 220, 374, 10745, 13, 220, 7209, 220, 1899, 566, 3643, 220, 2704, 429, 7722, 220, 23880, 220, 476, 1550, 4271, 220, 5590, 256, 525, 1667, 220, 369, 17233, 13, 220, 3017, 37494, 220, 2727, 429, 566, 2581, 220, 18707, 220, 10454, 220, 9080, 304, 279, 2805, 220, 4168, 220, 315, 882, 13, 220, 12090, 11, 220, 566, 16005, 220, 429, 1039, 2562, 220, 686, 3063, 220, 24020, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198], lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

My classmates  and I are talking  about  how to do during  the holiday.  We can chose  between  staying  at home  and take a trip. If we stay at home,  it is comfortable  but there  is no need  to spend  money.  But in that case,  we will learn  little about  world.  If we go on a trip abroad,  we can broaden  your view  and   gain knowledges  we cannot  get from  books.  Some  classmates  suggest  we can go to places  of interest  nearby.  I thought  that it is a good  idea.  It does not cost many,  yet we can still learn  a lot.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, best_of=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=-1, min_p=0.0, seed=None, use_beam_search=False, length_penalty=1.0, early_stopping=False, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=512, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None), prompt_token_ids: [151644, 8948, 198, 2610, 525, 264, 10950, 17847, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 872, 198, 56568, 101909, 22574, 101057, 3837, 100638, 31838, 89012, 106367, 14582, 25, 10236, 253, 255, 16744, 22418, 28726, 9909, 34369, 109, 16, 15, 30709, 33872, 3837, 73157, 30709, 33872, 220, 16, 17177, 3837, 115109, 220, 16, 15, 17177, 7552, 220, 4891, 223, 229, 22382, 104105, 99504, 17447, 101049, 101882, 40916, 100299, 101920, 106198, 25177, 104745, 41175, 112720, 25177, 56568, 40916, 100299, 107548, 87752, 104745, 1773, 16744, 102771, 18830, 220, 16, 15, 44290, 102064, 32100, 3837, 73157, 99700, 15946, 102538, 18830, 77540, 44290, 1773, 73157, 44290, 32100, 99373, 102031, 46944, 110011, 9370, 100649, 5373, 28606, 57191, 25177, 1773, 220, 4891, 95, 252, 20929, 5122, 18493, 99545, 99689, 44290, 20929, 46944, 100515, 48391, 17992, 9909, 73978, 48272, 104931, 41146, 100431, 112672, 75882, 20929, 9370, 99689, 1773, 220, 63073, 5122, 99360, 115917, 99689, 11622, 102669, 43268, 9909, 32495, 117, 101, 7552, 99492, 100373, 1773, 220, 63071, 5122, 18493, 28726, 9370, 99689, 16872, 99492, 14777, 101209, 43268, 90395, 18493, 75882, 99689, 100431, 112672, 25177, 104813, 99689, 1773, 220, 97161, 5122, 220, 16, 58883, 73157, 44290, 32100, 104204, 25177, 99472, 99373, 47149, 14777, 99689, 24968, 257, 220, 17, 58883, 91680, 102496, 25177, 220, 16, 15, 44290, 3837, 42140, 28946, 9909, 220, 45181, 29437, 220, 16, 16, 44290, 71618, 7552, 16530, 37643, 17177, 1773, 220, 576, 7324, 220, 13257, 220, 374, 5001, 13, 220, 3017, 60090, 220, 323, 358, 525, 7404, 220, 911, 220, 1246, 311, 653, 2337, 220, 279, 13257, 13, 220, 1205, 646, 14554, 220, 1948, 220, 19429, 220, 518, 2114, 220, 323, 1896, 264, 8411, 13, 1416, 582, 4717, 518, 2114, 11, 220, 432, 374, 10655, 220, 714, 1052, 220, 374, 902, 1184, 220, 311, 8329, 220, 3220, 13, 220, 1988, 304, 429, 1142, 11, 220, 582, 686, 3960, 220, 2632, 911, 220, 1879, 13, 220, 1416, 582, 728, 389, 264, 8411, 22131, 11, 220, 582, 646, 83613, 220, 697, 1651, 220, 323, 256, 8722, 1414, 832, 4188, 220, 582, 4157, 220, 633, 504, 220, 6467, 13, 220, 4329, 220, 60090, 220, 4190, 220, 582, 646, 728, 311, 7482, 220, 315, 2734, 220, 14046, 13, 220, 358, 3381, 220, 429, 432, 374, 264, 1661, 220, 4522, 13, 220, 1084, 1558, 537, 2783, 1657, 11, 220, 3602, 582, 646, 2058, 3960, 220, 264, 2696, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198], lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

They were also the best and worse years in my life. At the first, I thought I knew everything and could make decisions by yourself. However, my parents didn’t seem to think such. They always tell me what to do and how to do it. At one time, I even felt my parents couldn’t understand me so I hoped I could be freely from them. I showed them I was independent by wear strange clothes. Now I am leaving home to college. At last, I will be on my own, but I still want to have my parents to turn to whenever need help.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, best_of=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=-1, min_p=0.0, seed=None, use_beam_search=False, length_penalty=1.0, early_stopping=False, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=512, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None), prompt_token_ids: [151644, 8948, 198, 2610, 525, 264, 10950, 17847, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 872, 198, 56568, 101909, 22574, 101057, 3837, 100638, 31838, 89012, 106367, 14582, 25, 10236, 253, 255, 16744, 22418, 28726, 9909, 54899, 16, 15, 30709, 33872, 24968, 73157, 30709, 33872, 16, 17177, 3837, 115109, 16, 15, 17177, 7552, 99436, 22382, 104105, 99504, 17447, 101049, 101882, 40916, 100299, 101920, 106198, 25177, 104745, 37945, 56568, 25177, 56568, 40916, 100299, 107548, 87752, 104745, 1773, 16744, 102771, 18830, 16, 15, 44290, 102064, 32100, 3837, 73157, 99700, 15946, 102538, 18830, 77540, 44290, 1773, 73157, 44290, 32100, 99373, 102031, 46944, 110011, 9370, 100649, 5373, 28606, 57191, 25177, 1773, 100649, 5122, 18493, 99545, 99689, 44290, 20929, 46944, 100515, 48391, 17992, 7, 145264, 69515, 104931, 41146, 100431, 112672, 75882, 20929, 9370, 99689, 1773, 28606, 5122, 99360, 115917, 99689, 11622, 102669, 43268, 7, 144496, 8, 99492, 100373, 1773, 25177, 5122, 18493, 28726, 9370, 99689, 16872, 99492, 14777, 101209, 43268, 90395, 18493, 75882, 99689, 100431, 112672, 25177, 104813, 99689, 1773, 60533, 5122, 16, 58883, 73157, 44290, 32100, 104204, 25177, 99472, 99373, 47149, 14777, 99689, 24968, 17, 58883, 91680, 102496, 25177, 16, 15, 44290, 3837, 42140, 28946, 7, 45181, 29437, 16, 16, 44290, 71618, 8, 16530, 37643, 17177, 1773, 785, 33168, 1042, 504, 220, 16, 18, 311, 220, 16, 24, 1033, 279, 1429, 5000, 882, 369, 752, 13, 2379, 1033, 1083, 279, 1850, 323, 10960, 1635, 304, 847, 2272, 13, 2411, 279, 1156, 11, 358, 3381, 358, 6876, 4297, 323, 1410, 1281, 11181, 553, 6133, 13, 4354, 11, 847, 6562, 3207, 1405, 2803, 311, 1744, 1741, 13, 2379, 2677, 3291, 752, 1128, 311, 653, 323, 1246, 311, 653, 432, 13, 2411, 825, 882, 11, 358, 1496, 6476, 847, 6562, 7691, 1405, 3535, 752, 773, 358, 25189, 358, 1410, 387, 25580, 504, 1105, 13, 358, 8542, 1105, 358, 572, 9489, 553, 9850, 14888, 15097, 13, 4695, 358, 1079, 9380, 2114, 311, 7770, 13, 2411, 1537, 11, 358, 686, 387, 389, 847, 1828, 11, 714, 358, 2058, 1366, 311, 614, 847, 6562, 311, 2484, 311, 15356, 1184, 1492, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198], lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

I still remember  how hard first day was. Before  getting  into the car, I thought  I had learned  the instructor’s  orders,  so once  I started  the car, my mind  goes blank.  I forgot  what  he had said to me altogether.  The instructor  kept repeating  the word,  “Speed  up!” “Slow  down!”  “Turning  left!”  I was so much  nervous  that I could  hardly  tell which  direction  was left. A few minutes  late, the instructor  asked  me to stop the car. It was a relief  and I came  to a suddenly  stop just in the middle  on the road.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, best_of=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=-1, min_p=0.0, seed=None, use_beam_search=False, length_penalty=1.0, early_stopping=False, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=512, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None), prompt_token_ids: [151644, 8948, 198, 2610, 525, 264, 10950, 17847, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 872, 198, 56568, 101909, 22574, 101057, 3837, 100638, 31838, 89012, 106367, 14582, 25, 10236, 253, 255, 16744, 22418, 28726, 320, 54899, 16, 15, 30709, 33872, 24968, 73157, 30709, 33872, 326, 17177, 3837, 115109, 220, 16, 15, 17177, 8, 257, 4891, 223, 229, 22382, 104105, 99504, 17447, 101049, 101882, 40916, 100299, 101920, 106198, 25177, 104745, 37945, 56568, 25177, 56568, 40916, 100299, 107548, 87752, 104745, 1773, 16744, 102771, 18830, 220, 16, 15, 44290, 102064, 32100, 3837, 73157, 99700, 15946, 102538, 18830, 77540, 44290, 1773, 73157, 44290, 32100, 99373, 102031, 46944, 110011, 9370, 100649, 5373, 28606, 57191, 25177, 1773, 220, 4891, 95, 252, 20929, 5122, 18493, 99545, 99689, 44290, 20929, 46944, 100515, 48391, 17992, 94825, 100, 69515, 104931, 41146, 100431, 112672, 75882, 20929, 9370, 99689, 1773, 220, 63073, 5122, 99360, 115917, 99689, 11622, 102669, 43268, 320, 144496, 8, 99492, 100373, 1773, 220, 63071, 5122, 18493, 28726, 9370, 99689, 16872, 54623, 14777, 101209, 43268, 90395, 18493, 75882, 99689, 100431, 112672, 25177, 104813, 99689, 1773, 220, 97161, 5122, 220, 220, 16, 13, 6567, 107, 237, 44290, 32100, 104204, 25177, 99472, 99373, 47149, 14777, 99689, 24968, 220, 220, 17, 13, 26853, 103, 102496, 25177, 220, 16, 15, 44290, 3837, 42140, 28946, 320, 45181, 29437, 220, 16, 16, 44290, 71618, 873, 16530, 37643, 17177, 1773, 220, 758, 279, 7324, 220, 13257, 220, 2701, 220, 847, 62034, 220, 15198, 11, 220, 358, 3867, 9842, 220, 18366, 13, 220, 358, 2058, 6099, 220, 1246, 2588, 1156, 1899, 572, 13, 13235, 220, 3709, 220, 1119, 279, 1803, 11, 358, 3381, 220, 358, 1030, 9498, 220, 279, 32215, 748, 220, 10163, 11, 220, 773, 3055, 220, 358, 3855, 220, 279, 1803, 11, 847, 3971, 220, 5780, 10113, 13, 220, 358, 28595, 220, 1128, 220, 566, 1030, 1053, 311, 752, 30055, 13, 220, 576, 32215, 220, 8604, 39816, 220, 279, 3409, 11, 220, 1036, 11056, 220, 705, 17839, 1036, 58289, 220, 1495, 17839, 220, 1036, 97851, 220, 2115, 17839, 220, 358, 572, 773, 1753, 220, 22596, 220, 429, 358, 1410, 220, 20171, 220, 3291, 892, 220, 5106, 220, 572, 2115, 13, 362, 2421, 4420, 220, 3309, 11, 279, 32215, 220, 4588, 220, 752, 311, 2936, 279, 1803, 13, 1084, 572, 264, 15957, 220, 323, 358, 3697, 220, 311, 264, 14843, 220, 2936, 1101, 304, 279, 6149, 220, 389, 279, 5636, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198], lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

They  live far from  the school,  and it takes  them  about  a hour and a half to go to work  every  day. In their spare  time,  they are interesting  in planting  vegetables  in their garden,  that is on the rooftop  of their house.  They  often  get up earlier  and water  the vegetables  together.  They  have  also bought  for some  gardening  tools.  Beside,  they often  get some  useful  informations  from  the internet.  When  summer  came,  they will invite  their students  pick the vegetables !<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, best_of=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=-1, min_p=0.0, seed=None, use_beam_search=False, length_penalty=1.0, early_stopping=False, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=512, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None), prompt_token_ids: [151644, 8948, 198, 2610, 525, 264, 10950, 17847, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 872, 198, 56568, 101909, 22574, 101057, 3837, 100638, 31838, 89012, 106367, 14582, 25, 10236, 253, 255, 16744, 22418, 28726, 9909, 34369, 109, 16, 15, 30709, 33872, 24968, 73157, 30709, 33872, 220, 16, 17177, 3837, 115109, 220, 16, 15, 17177, 7552, 220, 4891, 223, 229, 22382, 104105, 99504, 17447, 101049, 101882, 40916, 100299, 101920, 106198, 25177, 104745, 41175, 112720, 25177, 56568, 40916, 100299, 107548, 87752, 104745, 1773, 16744, 102771, 18830, 220, 16, 15, 44290, 102064, 32100, 3837, 73157, 99700, 15946, 102538, 18830, 77540, 44290, 24968, 47764, 659, 69526, 31139, 220, 6567, 107, 237, 44290, 32100, 99373, 102031, 46944, 110011, 9370, 100649, 5373, 28606, 57191, 25177, 1773, 220, 4891, 95, 252, 20929, 5122, 18493, 99545, 99689, 44290, 20929, 46944, 100515, 48391, 17992, 94825, 100, 69515, 104931, 41146, 100431, 112672, 75882, 20929, 9370, 99689, 1773, 220, 63073, 5122, 99360, 115917, 99689, 11622, 102669, 43268, 9909, 1124, 7552, 99492, 100373, 1773, 220, 63071, 5122, 18493, 28726, 9370, 99689, 16872, 99492, 14777, 101209, 43268, 90395, 18493, 75882, 99689, 100431, 112672, 25177, 9370, 99689, 1773, 220, 97161, 5122, 220, 16, 13, 73157, 44290, 32100, 104204, 25177, 99472, 99373, 47149, 14777, 99689, 24968, 220, 220, 17, 13, 91680, 102496, 25177, 220, 16, 15, 44290, 3837, 42140, 28946, 320, 45181, 29437, 220, 16, 16, 44290, 71618, 873, 16530, 37643, 17177, 1773, 220, 4392, 13, 323, 17618, 13, 36020, 220, 678, 975, 220, 304, 1039, 2906, 13, 220, 2379, 220, 3887, 3041, 504, 220, 279, 2906, 11, 220, 323, 432, 4990, 220, 1105, 220, 911, 220, 264, 6460, 323, 264, 4279, 311, 728, 311, 975, 220, 1449, 220, 1899, 13, 758, 862, 23863, 220, 882, 11, 220, 807, 525, 7040, 220, 304, 47014, 220, 23880, 220, 304, 862, 13551, 11, 220, 429, 374, 389, 279, 66192, 220, 315, 862, 3753, 13, 220, 2379, 220, 3545, 220, 633, 705, 6788, 220, 323, 3015, 220, 279, 23880, 220, 3786, 13, 220, 2379, 220, 614, 220, 1083, 10788, 220, 369, 1045, 220, 59199, 220, 7375, 13, 220, 18078, 577, 11, 220, 807, 3545, 220, 633, 1045, 220, 5390, 220, 43727, 220, 504, 220, 279, 7602, 13, 220, 3197, 220, 7324, 220, 3697, 11, 220, 807, 686, 21399, 220, 862, 4143, 220, 3735, 279, 23880, 753, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198], lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

I realize of how fast time flies. I had grown not only physically, and also mentally in the past few years. About one month after this photo was took, I entered my second year of high school and become a new member of the school music club. Around me in picture are the things they were very important in my life at that time; car magazines and musical instruments. I enjoyed studying difference kinds of cars and planes, playing pop music, and collecting the late music albums. This picture often brings back to me many happy memories of your high school days.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, best_of=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=-1, min_p=0.0, seed=None, use_beam_search=False, length_penalty=1.0, early_stopping=False, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=512, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None), prompt_token_ids: [151644, 8948, 198, 2610, 525, 264, 10950, 17847, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 872, 198, 56568, 101909, 22574, 101057, 3837, 100638, 31838, 89012, 106367, 14582, 25, 10236, 253, 255, 16744, 22418, 28726, 220, 320, 54899, 16, 15, 30709, 33872, 24968, 73157, 30709, 33872, 75, 17177, 3837, 115109, 16, 15, 17177, 8, 262, 4891, 223, 229, 22382, 104105, 99504, 17447, 101049, 101882, 40916, 100299, 101920, 106198, 25177, 104745, 37945, 56568, 25177, 56568, 40916, 100299, 107548, 87752, 104745, 1773, 16744, 102771, 18830, 16, 15, 44290, 102064, 32100, 3837, 73157, 99700, 15946, 102538, 18830, 77540, 44290, 1773, 73157, 44290, 32100, 99373, 102031, 46944, 110011, 9370, 100649, 5373, 28606, 57191, 25177, 1773, 100649, 5122, 18493, 99545, 99689, 44290, 20929, 46944, 100515, 48391, 17992, 7, 145264, 69515, 104931, 41146, 100431, 112672, 75882, 20929, 9370, 99689, 1773, 28606, 5122, 99360, 115917, 99689, 11622, 102669, 43268, 7, 144496, 8, 99492, 100373, 1773, 25177, 5122, 18493, 28726, 9370, 99689, 16872, 99492, 14777, 101209, 43268, 90395, 18493, 75882, 99689, 100431, 112672, 25177, 104813, 99689, 1773, 60533, 5122, 16, 13, 6567, 107, 237, 44290, 32100, 104204, 25177, 99472, 99373, 47149, 14777, 99689, 24968, 17, 13, 26853, 103, 102496, 25177, 16, 15, 44290, 3837, 42140, 28946, 7, 45181, 29437, 16, 16, 44290, 71618, 8, 16530, 37643, 17177, 1773, 4498, 358, 1401, 518, 419, 6802, 315, 7037, 13, 358, 13083, 315, 1246, 4937, 882, 37104, 13, 358, 1030, 14700, 537, 1172, 21893, 11, 323, 1083, 33225, 304, 279, 3267, 2421, 1635, 13, 9975, 825, 2254, 1283, 419, 6548, 572, 3867, 11, 358, 10636, 847, 2086, 1042, 315, 1550, 2906, 323, 3635, 264, 501, 4462, 315, 279, 2906, 4627, 6335, 13, 32816, 752, 304, 6802, 525, 279, 2513, 807, 1033, 1602, 2989, 304, 847, 2272, 518, 429, 882, 26, 1803, 31847, 323, 17795, 23316, 13, 358, 14006, 20956, 6672, 12829, 315, 9331, 323, 24730, 11, 5619, 2420, 4627, 11, 323, 25895, 279, 3309, 4627, 27685, 13, 1096, 6802, 3545, 12434, 1182, 311, 752, 1657, 6247, 18923, 315, 697, 1550, 2906, 2849, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198], lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

I find a change  there.  The first time I went  there,  they were  living  in a small  house  with dogs,  ducks,  and another  animals.

At that moment, I remembered that my father once said, “The classroom is a place for learning and that include leaning from textbooks, and mistake as well.” Immediate, I raised my hand.学<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, best_of=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=-1, min_p=0.0, seed=None, use_beam_search=False, length_penalty=1.0, early_stopping=False, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=512, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None), prompt_token_ids: [151644, 8948, 198, 2610, 525, 264, 10950, 17847, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 872, 198, 56568, 101909, 22574, 101057, 3837, 100638, 31838, 89012, 106367, 14582, 25, 10236, 253, 255, 16744, 22418, 28726, 9909, 54899, 16, 15, 30709, 33872, 24968, 73157, 30709, 33872, 16, 17177, 3837, 115109, 16, 15, 17177, 7552, 99436, 22382, 104105, 99504, 17447, 101049, 101882, 40916, 100299, 101920, 106198, 25177, 104745, 37945, 56568, 25177, 56568, 40916, 100299, 107548, 87752, 104745, 3837, 16744, 102771, 18830, 16, 15, 44290, 102064, 32100, 3837, 73157, 99700, 15946, 102538, 18830, 77540, 44290, 3837, 73157, 44290, 32100, 99373, 102031, 46944, 110011, 9370, 100649, 5373, 109218, 22418, 57191, 25177, 1773, 100649, 5122, 18493, 99545, 99689, 44290, 20929, 46944, 100515, 48391, 17992, 9909, 145322, 48272, 104931, 41146, 100431, 112672, 75882, 20929, 9370, 99689, 1773, 28606, 5122, 99360, 115917, 99689, 11622, 102669, 43268, 9909, 59, 7552, 99492, 100373, 1773, 25177, 5122, 18493, 28726, 9370, 99689, 16872, 99492, 14777, 101209, 43268, 90395, 18493, 75882, 99689, 100431, 112672, 25177, 104813, 99689, 1773, 97161, 5122, 16, 13, 73157, 44290, 32100, 104204, 25177, 99472, 99373, 47149, 14777, 99689, 24968, 414, 220, 17, 13, 91680, 102496, 25177, 16, 15, 44290, 3837, 42140, 28946, 9909, 45181, 29437, 16, 16, 44290, 71618, 7552, 16530, 37643, 17177, 1773, 2132, 572, 7014, 6556, 11, 323, 279, 4378, 536, 1030, 1101, 3161, 13, 21455, 572, 21059, 11, 3783, 311, 1490, 879, 1035, 387, 2598, 5193, 311, 1349, 806, 323, 1059, 14311, 70411, 13, 4329, 315, 601, 1033, 16506, 323, 23541, 1896, 949, 304, 279, 536, 5702, 11, 3800, 1033, 22596, 323, 37000, 13, 358, 1030, 2814, 7037, 28459, 714, 358, 572, 32294, 13, 358, 572, 16575, 429, 311, 6468, 304, 4065, 315, 264, 8131, 1874, 315, 1251, 13, 2411, 429, 4445, 11, 358, 26471, 429, 847, 6981, 3055, 1053, 11, 1036, 785, 24017, 374, 264, 1992, 369, 6832, 323, 429, 2924, 48348, 504, 64203, 11, 323, 16523, 438, 1632, 1987, 80310, 11, 358, 9226, 847, 1424, 13, 47764, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198], lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

One afternoon where I was in primary school, I was walking by the school playground. Suddenly football fell just in front of me but almost hit me. I stopped the ball and kicked it hardly back to the playground. To everyone`s surprising, the ball went into the net. All the football player on the playground cheered loudly, say that I had a talent for football. From now on, I started to play my football with classmates after school. I am a good player now.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, best_of=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=-1, min_p=0.0, seed=None, use_beam_search=False, length_penalty=1.0, early_stopping=False, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=512, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None), prompt_token_ids: [151644, 8948, 198, 2610, 525, 264, 10950, 17847, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 872, 198, 56568, 101909, 22574, 101057, 3837, 100638, 31838, 89012, 106367, 14582, 25, 10236, 253, 255, 16744, 22418, 28726, 7, 54899, 16, 15, 30709, 33872, 24968, 73157, 30709, 33872, 16, 17177, 3837, 115109, 16, 15, 17177, 8, 22, 16, 13, 99436, 22382, 104105, 99504, 17447, 101049, 101882, 40916, 100299, 101920, 106198, 25177, 104745, 37945, 56568, 25177, 56568, 40916, 100299, 107548, 87752, 104745, 1773, 16744, 102771, 18830, 16, 15, 44290, 102064, 32100, 3837, 73157, 99700, 15946, 102538, 18830, 77540, 44290, 1773, 73157, 44290, 32100, 99373, 102031, 46944, 110011, 9370, 100649, 5373, 28606, 57191, 25177, 1773, 100649, 25, 18493, 99545, 99689, 44290, 20929, 46944, 100515, 48391, 17992, 7, 145264, 69515, 104931, 41146, 100431, 112672, 75882, 20929, 9370, 99689, 1773, 28606, 25, 99360, 115917, 99689, 11622, 102669, 43268, 11520, 8, 99492, 100373, 1773, 25177, 25, 18493, 28726, 9370, 99689, 16872, 99492, 14777, 101209, 43268, 90395, 18493, 75882, 99689, 100431, 112672, 25177, 104813, 99689, 1773, 60533, 25, 16, 13, 73157, 44290, 32100, 104204, 25177, 99472, 99373, 47149, 14777, 99689, 24968, 17, 13, 91680, 102496, 25177, 16, 15, 44290, 3837, 42140, 28946, 7, 45181, 29437, 16, 16, 44290, 71618, 8, 16530, 37643, 17177, 1773, 40, 6116, 7040, 304, 5619, 8964, 9339, 311, 264, 2613, 11423, 13, 3776, 13354, 1380, 358, 572, 304, 6028, 2906, 11, 358, 572, 11435, 553, 279, 2906, 41615, 13, 57701, 8964, 11052, 1101, 304, 4065, 315, 752, 714, 4558, 4201, 752, 13, 358, 10497, 279, 4935, 323, 27120, 432, 20171, 1182, 311, 279, 41615, 13, 2014, 5019, 39829, 14861, 11, 279, 4935, 3937, 1119, 279, 4179, 13, 2009, 279, 8964, 2781, 389, 279, 41615, 84523, 53845, 11, 1977, 429, 358, 1030, 264, 10772, 369, 8964, 13, 5542, 1431, 389, 11, 358, 3855, 311, 1486, 847, 8964, 448, 60090, 1283, 2906, 13, 358, 1079, 264, 1661, 2781, 1431, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198], lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

First, I wanted to be a fireman, whose uniform looked so coolly. Then, when I was in the five grade, I wanted to be a teacher because I liked my English teacher too much. When I studied chemistry high school, I reconsidered mg goal or decided to be a doctor. They were two reasons for the decision. One was that I was amazing at the fact that a sick person could feel much more better after seeing a doctor.

I like eating frying tomatoes with eggs, and I thought it must to be easy to cook. My mom told me how to preparing it. First I cut the tomatoes into pieces but put them aside.  Next I broke the eggs into a bowl and beat them quickly with chopstick. After that I poured oil into a pan and turned off the stove， I waited patiently unless the oil was hot.  Then I put the tomatoes and the beaten eggs into pan together.  ＂Not that way，＂ my mom tried to stop us but failed.  She was right.

I’m glad to know that you’ve come China to learn kung fu in a school in my hometown. I’m surely you’ll have a good time. Actually, I start to learn kung fu when I was seven years old, for I have long been out of practice. Luckily, I will go home in two weeks for summer vacations. Then I can spare some time to learn it again, such that we can practice together on every day. Best of luck with yours learning kung fu in China.

Understanding her good intentions, I eat all the food what is provided by Mom with appreciation.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, best_of=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=-1, min_p=0.0, seed=None, use_beam_search=False, length_penalty=1.0, early_stopping=False, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=512, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None), prompt_token_ids: [151644, 8948, 198, 2610, 525, 264, 10950, 17847, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 872, 198, 56568, 101909, 22574, 101057, 3837, 100638, 31838, 89012, 106367, 14582, 25, 10236, 253, 255, 16744, 22418, 28726, 7, 54899, 16, 15, 30709, 33872, 24968, 73157, 30709, 33872, 16, 17177, 3837, 115109, 16, 15, 17177, 8, 22, 16, 13, 99436, 22382, 104105, 99504, 17447, 101049, 101882, 40916, 100299, 101920, 106198, 25177, 104745, 37945, 56568, 25177, 56568, 40916, 100299, 107548, 87752, 104745, 1773, 16744, 102771, 18830, 16, 15, 44290, 102064, 32100, 3837, 73157, 99700, 15946, 102538, 18830, 77540, 44290, 1773, 73157, 44290, 32100, 99373, 102031, 46944, 110011, 9370, 100649, 5373, 28606, 57191, 25177, 1773, 100649, 25, 18493, 99545, 99689, 44290, 20929, 46944, 100515, 48391, 17992, 7, 145264, 69515, 104931, 41146, 100431, 112672, 75882, 20929, 9370, 99689, 1773, 28606, 25, 99360, 115917, 99689, 11622, 102669, 43268, 11520, 8, 99492, 100373, 1773, 25177, 25, 18493, 28726, 9370, 99689, 16872, 99492, 14777, 101209, 43268, 90395, 18493, 75882, 99689, 100431, 112672, 25177, 104813, 99689, 1773, 60533, 25, 16, 13, 6567, 107, 237, 44290, 32100, 104204, 25177, 99472, 99373, 47149, 14777, 99689, 24968, 17, 13, 26853, 103, 102496, 25177, 16, 15, 44290, 3837, 42140, 28946, 7, 45181, 29437, 16, 16, 44290, 71618, 8, 16530, 37643, 17177, 1773, 5050, 3368, 374, 2167, 18310, 448, 279, 2820, 315, 5019, 304, 1039, 8521, 13, 758, 1973, 311, 1281, 21502, 678, 315, 601, 525, 304, 1661, 2820, 11, 323, 1340, 3643, 3151, 6649, 369, 601, 13, 1752, 3110, 11, 1449, 6556, 11, 847, 17760, 702, 311, 614, 279, 19212, 315, 18636, 19174, 1393, 358, 1030, 311, 8180, 458, 23268, 13, 3017, 17760, 1513, 1405, 1075, 279, 19174, 323, 358, 1513, 1405, 4669, 40676, 13, 358, 3291, 847, 3368, 429, 421, 582, 3129, 9575, 8180, 2513, 11, 582, 1231, 3635, 5862, 52601, 566, 42346, 389, 601, 12182, 9314, 3607, 13, 45451, 1059, 1661, 33234, 11, 358, 8180, 678, 279, 3607, 1128, 374, 3897, 553, 22180, 448, 34896, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198], lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

I always assist my parents in doing the dish after meals. I also water the flowers in the yard and tidying up my own bedroom whatever necessary. In my opinion, students can benefit a lot doing some housework. Firstly, doing housework was helpful for us to be a responsible person. Also, it gives our parents more time to do what they are like and it improves the family relationship. What’s most, doing housework can be a form of mentally relaxation from study. That’s our view on housework. And hopes this can inspire more thinking on the topic!<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, best_of=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=-1, min_p=0.0, seed=None, use_beam_search=False, length_penalty=1.0, early_stopping=False, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=512, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None), prompt_token_ids: [151644, 8948, 198, 2610, 525, 264, 10950, 17847, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 872, 198, 56568, 101909, 22574, 101057, 3837, 100638, 31838, 89012, 106367, 14582, 25, 10236, 253, 255, 16744, 22418, 28726, 9909, 54899, 16, 15, 30709, 33872, 24968, 73157, 30709, 33872, 16, 17177, 3837, 115109, 16, 15, 17177, 7552, 22, 16, 13, 4891, 223, 229, 22382, 104105, 99504, 17447, 101049, 101882, 40916, 100299, 101920, 106198, 25177, 104745, 37945, 56568, 25177, 56568, 40916, 100299, 107548, 87752, 104745, 1773, 16744, 102771, 18830, 16, 15, 44290, 102064, 32100, 3837, 73157, 99700, 15946, 102538, 18830, 77540, 44290, 1773, 73157, 44290, 32100, 99373, 102031, 46944, 110011, 9370, 100649, 5373, 28606, 57191, 25177, 1773, 100649, 5122, 18493, 99545, 99689, 44290, 20929, 46944, 100515, 48391, 17992, 9909, 145264, 48272, 104931, 41146, 100431, 112672, 75882, 20929, 9370, 99689, 1773, 28606, 5122, 99360, 115917, 99689, 11622, 102669, 43268, 9909, 59, 7552, 99492, 100373, 1773, 25177, 5122, 18493, 28726, 9370, 99689, 16872, 99492, 14777, 101209, 43268, 90395, 18493, 75882, 99689, 100431, 112672, 25177, 104813, 99689, 1773, 60533, 5122, 16, 13, 6567, 107, 237, 44290, 32100, 104204, 25177, 99472, 99373, 47149, 14777, 99689, 24968, 17, 13, 26853, 103, 102496, 25177, 16, 15, 44290, 3837, 42140, 28946, 9909, 45181, 29437, 16, 16, 44290, 71618, 7552, 16530, 37643, 17177, 1773, 40, 2948, 3730, 3753, 1778, 13, 358, 2677, 7789, 847, 6562, 304, 3730, 279, 12000, 1283, 20969, 13, 358, 1083, 3015, 279, 19281, 304, 279, 19515, 323, 13112, 7024, 705, 847, 1828, 13829, 8820, 5871, 13, 758, 847, 9459, 11, 4143, 646, 8760, 264, 2696, 3730, 1045, 3753, 1778, 13, 76695, 11, 3730, 3753, 1778, 572, 10950, 369, 601, 311, 387, 264, 8480, 1697, 13, 7281, 11, 432, 6696, 1039, 6562, 803, 882, 311, 653, 1128, 807, 525, 1075, 323, 432, 34950, 279, 2997, 5025, 13, 3555, 748, 1429, 11, 3730, 3753, 1778, 646, 387, 264, 1352, 315, 33225, 42585, 504, 3920, 13, 2938, 748, 1039, 1651, 389, 3753, 1778, 13, 1597, 16005, 419, 646, 30640, 803, 7274, 389, 279, 8544, 0, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198], lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

One of the questions are：Who will you go in times of trouble? Here are the results. Many students say they will talk to their friend or classmates because they're of the same age and can understand each other. Some will turn out to their parents or teachers for help. Only a little choose to deal with the problems on our own. Their answers also show that they dislike talk to others. They kept very much to themselves. In my opinion, where in trouble, we should seek help from those we trust mostly.短文改错：<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", params: SamplingParams(n=1, best_of=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=-1, min_p=0.0, seed=None, use_beam_search=False, length_penalty=1.0, early_stopping=False, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=512, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None), prompt_token_ids: [151644, 8948, 198, 2610, 525, 264, 10950, 17847, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 872, 198, 56568, 101909, 22574, 101057, 3837, 100638, 31838, 89012, 106367, 14582, 25, 10236, 253, 255, 16744, 22418, 28726, 9909, 54899, 16, 15, 30709, 33872, 5122, 73157, 30709, 33872, 16, 17177, 17177, 16, 15, 17177, 7552, 20, 16, 13, 4891, 223, 229, 22382, 104105, 99504, 17447, 101049, 101882, 40916, 100299, 101920, 106198, 25177, 104147, 37945, 56568, 25177, 56568, 40916, 100299, 107548, 87752, 104745, 1773, 16744, 102771, 18830, 16, 15, 44290, 102064, 32100, 3837, 73157, 99700, 15946, 102538, 18830, 77540, 44290, 1773, 73157, 44290, 32100, 99373, 102031, 46944, 110011, 9370, 100649, 5373, 28606, 57191, 25177, 1773, 100649, 5122, 18493, 99545, 99689, 44290, 20929, 46944, 100515, 48391, 17992, 9909, 145264, 48272, 104931, 41146, 100431, 112672, 75882, 20929, 99689, 1773, 28606, 5122, 99360, 115917, 99689, 11622, 102669, 43268, 9909, 59, 7552, 99492, 100373, 1773, 25177, 5122, 18493, 28726, 9370, 99689, 16872, 99492, 14777, 101209, 43268, 90395, 18493, 75882, 99689, 100431, 112672, 25177, 104813, 99689, 1773, 60533, 5122, 16, 13, 73157, 44290, 32100, 104204, 25177, 99472, 99373, 47149, 14777, 99689, 24968, 17, 13, 91680, 102496, 25177, 16, 15, 44290, 3837, 42140, 28946, 9909, 45181, 29437, 16, 16, 44290, 71618, 7552, 16530, 37643, 17177, 1773, 5842, 2003, 1039, 11079, 4588, 601, 311, 5155, 304, 264, 47864, 13, 3776, 315, 279, 4755, 525, 5122, 15191, 686, 498, 728, 304, 3039, 315, 12264, 30, 5692, 525, 279, 3059, 13, 8999, 4143, 1977, 807, 686, 3061, 311, 862, 4238, 476, 60090, 1576, 807, 2299, 315, 279, 1852, 4231, 323, 646, 3535, 1817, 1008, 13, 4329, 686, 2484, 700, 311, 862, 6562, 476, 13336, 369, 1492, 13, 8278, 264, 2632, 5157, 311, 3484, 448, 279, 5322, 389, 1039, 1828, 13, 10964, 11253, 1083, 1473, 429, 807, 47869, 3061, 311, 3800, 13, 2379, 8604, 1602, 1753, 311, 5577, 13, 758, 847, 9459, 11, 1380, 304, 12264, 11, 582, 1265, 5931, 1492, 504, 1846, 582, 6950, 10008, 13, 99534, 16744, 22418, 28726, 5122, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198], lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

A doctor tells me people who lives the longest are dancers and cyclists. Maybe it is because the combination of fresh air, smooth movement and exercise. Whether you ride a bicycle, you don’t use petrol. So they are not producing carbon dioxide and not cause air pollution. Just see how cars have been taken over our cities. They often run at high speeds, what may put our lives in danger. And there were traffic jams, too. Our cities will be better places if we replace cars with bicycle.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, best_of=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=-1, min_p=0.0, seed=None, use_beam_search=False, length_penalty=1.0, early_stopping=False, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=512, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None), prompt_token_ids: [151644, 8948, 198, 2610, 525, 264, 10950, 17847, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 872, 198, 56568, 101909, 22574, 101057, 3837, 100638, 31838, 89012, 106367, 14582, 25, 10236, 253, 255, 16744, 22418, 28726, 7, 54899, 16, 15, 30709, 33872, 26, 73157, 30709, 33872, 16, 17177, 3837, 115109, 16, 15, 17177, 8, 20, 16, 13, 4891, 223, 229, 22382, 104105, 99504, 17447, 101049, 101882, 40916, 100299, 101920, 106198, 25177, 104745, 37945, 56568, 25177, 56568, 40916, 100299, 107548, 87752, 104745, 1773, 16744, 102771, 18830, 16, 15, 44290, 102064, 32100, 3837, 73157, 99700, 15946, 102538, 18830, 77540, 44290, 1773, 73157, 44290, 32100, 99373, 102031, 46944, 110011, 9370, 100649, 5373, 28606, 57191, 25177, 100649, 5122, 18493, 99545, 99689, 44290, 20929, 46944, 100515, 48391, 17992, 33810, 69515, 104931, 41146, 100431, 112672, 75882, 20929, 9370, 99689, 1773, 28606, 5122, 99360, 115917, 99689, 11622, 102669, 43268, 11520, 8, 99492, 100373, 1773, 25177, 5122, 18493, 28726, 9370, 99689, 16872, 99492, 14777, 101209, 43268, 90395, 18493, 75882, 99689, 100431, 112672, 25177, 104813, 99689, 1773, 60533, 5122, 16, 58883, 73157, 44290, 32100, 104204, 25177, 99472, 99373, 47149, 14777, 99689, 26, 17, 58883, 91680, 102496, 25177, 16, 15, 44290, 3837, 42140, 28946, 7, 45181, 29437, 16, 16, 44290, 71618, 8, 16530, 37643, 17177, 1773, 1654, 678, 1414, 429, 32062, 374, 264, 18875, 10158, 13, 362, 10668, 10742, 752, 1251, 879, 6305, 279, 22032, 525, 60483, 323, 55083, 13, 10696, 432, 374, 1576, 279, 10601, 315, 7722, 3720, 11, 10876, 7203, 323, 10158, 13, 13139, 498, 11877, 264, 34986, 11, 498, 1513, 1405, 990, 57083, 13, 2055, 807, 525, 537, 17387, 12499, 39489, 323, 537, 5240, 3720, 24761, 13, 4599, 1490, 1246, 9331, 614, 1012, 4429, 916, 1039, 9720, 13, 2379, 3545, 1598, 518, 1550, 24722, 11, 1128, 1231, 2182, 1039, 6305, 304, 7978, 13, 1597, 1052, 1033, 9442, 89298, 11, 2238, 13, 5633, 9720, 686, 387, 2664, 7482, 421, 582, 8290, 9331, 448, 34986, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198], lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

He showed me how his medical instruments was used. I felt so closely to him. However, after I went to high school, somehow I become distant from him. I was unwilling talk with him and often disobeyed his rule of not stay out with my friends too late. The disagreement was too sharp that neither he nor I knew what to settle it. One day, he talked with me or hoped to mend our relations. With the efforts made by all sides, we began to understand each other better.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, best_of=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=-1, min_p=0.0, seed=None, use_beam_search=False, length_penalty=1.0, early_stopping=False, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=512, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None), prompt_token_ids: [151644, 8948, 198, 2610, 525, 264, 10950, 17847, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 872, 198, 56568, 101909, 22574, 101057, 3837, 100638, 31838, 89012, 106367, 14582, 25, 10236, 253, 255, 16744, 22418, 28726, 320, 54899, 16, 15, 30709, 33872, 24968, 73157, 30709, 33872, 16, 17177, 3837, 115109, 16, 15, 17177, 8, 220, 20, 16, 13, 4891, 223, 229, 22382, 104105, 99504, 17447, 101049, 101882, 40916, 100299, 101920, 106198, 25177, 104745, 37945, 56568, 25177, 56568, 40916, 100299, 107548, 87752, 104745, 1773, 16744, 102771, 18830, 16, 15, 44290, 102064, 32100, 3837, 73157, 99700, 15946, 102538, 18830, 77540, 44290, 1773, 73157, 44290, 32100, 99373, 102031, 46944, 110011, 9370, 100649, 5373, 28606, 57191, 25177, 1773, 100649, 5122, 18493, 99545, 99689, 44290, 20929, 46944, 100515, 48391, 17992, 9909, 145264, 48272, 104931, 41146, 100431, 112672, 75882, 20929, 9370, 99689, 1773, 28606, 5122, 99360, 115917, 99689, 11622, 102669, 43268, 9909, 59, 7552, 99492, 100373, 1773, 25177, 5122, 18493, 28726, 9370, 99689, 16872, 99492, 14777, 101209, 43268, 90395, 18493, 75882, 99689, 100431, 112672, 25177, 104813, 99689, 1773, 60533, 5122, 16, 13, 6567, 107, 237, 44290, 32100, 104204, 25177, 99472, 99373, 47149, 14777, 99689, 24968, 17, 13, 26853, 103, 102496, 25177, 16, 15, 44290, 3837, 42140, 28946, 9909, 45181, 29437, 16, 16, 44290, 71618, 7552, 16530, 37643, 17177, 1773, 5050, 6981, 3545, 3867, 752, 311, 806, 8777, 979, 358, 572, 1007, 847, 2906, 13, 1260, 8542, 752, 1246, 806, 6457, 23316, 572, 1483, 13, 358, 6476, 773, 15148, 311, 1435, 13, 4354, 11, 1283, 358, 3937, 311, 1550, 2906, 11, 16925, 358, 3635, 28727, 504, 1435, 13, 358, 572, 45143, 3061, 448, 1435, 323, 3545, 67635, 47959, 806, 5912, 315, 537, 4717, 700, 448, 847, 4780, 2238, 3309, 13, 576, 61546, 572, 2238, 17232, 429, 13866, 566, 6329, 358, 6876, 1128, 311, 24729, 432, 13, 3776, 1899, 11, 566, 14897, 448, 752, 476, 25189, 311, 44776, 1039, 4300, 13, 3085, 279, 8869, 1865, 553, 678, 11067, 11, 582, 6009, 311, 3535, 1817, 1008, 2664, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198], lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

It \u3000 61  \u3000（be）unimaginable  that it could  ever be cleaned  up. The river  was so polluted  that it\u3000 62  \u3000（actual）caught  fire and burned . Now , years  later, this river  is one of \u3000 63  \u3000 most  outstanding  examples  of environmental  cleanup . But the river  wasn ’t changed  in a few days\u3000 64   even  a few months . It took   years  of work\u3000 65   （reduce） the industrial  pollution  and clean  the water . Finally , that hard work  paid off and now the water  in the river  is\u3000 66  \u3000（clean）than ever. Maybe  you are facing  an impossible  situation . Maybe  you have  a habit   67   is driving  your family  crazy . Possibly  you drink  too much  or don’t know  how to control  your credit  card use. When  you face such an impossible  situation , don’t you want  a quick  fix and something  to change  immediately ? While  there  are \u3000 68  （amaze） stories  of instant  transformation , for most  of us the\u3000 69  \u3000（change） are gradual  and require  a lot of effort  and work , like cleaning  up a polluted  river .

There  were  many  people  waiting  at the bus stop, \u300062    some  of them  looked  very anxious  and \u3000  63 \u3000（disappoint ）. When  the bus finally  came , we all   hurried  on board . I got a place  next \u300064    the window , so I had a good  view  of the sidewalk . A boy on a bike \u3000 65  （catch）my attention . He was riding  beside  the bus and waving  his arms . I heard  a passenger  behind  me shouting  to the driver , but he refused  \u3000 66  （stop）until we reached  the next stop. Still, the boy kept \u3000 67  （ride）. He was carrying  something  over his shoulder  and shouting . Finally , when  we came  to the next stop, the boy ran up to the door of the bus. I heard  an excited  conversation .

It’s \u300069   （I）.” She pushed  her way to the driver  and took the suitcase  thankfully .

But I didn’t  care.  A few hours     62   , I’d been  at home  in Hong  Kong,  with      63    (it) choking  smog.  Here,  the air was clean  and fresh,  even  with the rain.

Instead,   I’d headed  straight  for Yangshuo.  For those  who fly to Guilin,  it’s only an hour away     66    car and offers  all the scenery  of the better-known  city.  Yangshuo     67    (be) really  beautiful.  A study  of travelers     68    (conduct)  by the website  TripAdvisor  names  Yangshuo  as one of the top 10 destinations  in the world.

They can also be made of plastic, animal bone or metal. Sometimes chopsticks are quite artistic. Truly elegant chopsticks might    62    (make) of gold and silver with Chinese characters. Skilled workers also combine various hardwoods and metal    63    (create) special designs.The Chinese have used chopsticks for five thousand years. People probably cooked their food in large pots,    64    (use) twigs (树枝) to remove it. Over time,    65    the population grew, people began cutting food into small pieces so it would cook more quickly. Food in small pieces could be eaten easily with twigs which    66    (gradual) turned into chopsticks.Some people think that the great Chinese scholar Confucius,    67    lived from roughly 551 to 479 B.C., influenced the    68    (develop) of chopsticks. Confucius believed knives would remind people of killings and    69    (be) too violent for use at the table.Chopsticks are not used everywhere in Asia. In India, for example, most people traditionally eat    70    their hands.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, best_of=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=-1, min_p=0.0, seed=None, use_beam_search=False, length_penalty=1.0, early_stopping=False, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=512, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None), prompt_token_ids: [151644, 8948, 198, 2610, 525, 264, 10950, 17847, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 872, 198, 56568, 101909, 22574, 101057, 3837, 100638, 31838, 89012, 106367, 14582, 25, 18137, 246, 227, 57553, 100431, 100643, 96050, 107762, 44290, 68756, 17254, 102618, 104597, 9909, 16, 18947, 110011, 7552, 57191, 100139, 17992, 31843, 110011, 9370, 88991, 100414, 1773, 641, 1753, 315, 13622, 11, 5310, 279, 773, 18900, 1036, 23120, 19212, 854, 26735, 315, 5616, 11, 6323, 11, 11862, 11, 262, 220, 21, 16, 262, 22500, 11, 3607, 374, 5990, 34561, 448, 46994, 68945, 6353, 453, 68945, 525, 5990, 1378, 1293, 11, 15430, 9666, 315, 7579, 476, 58882, 13, 2379, 646, 1083, 387, 1865, 315, 12188, 11, 9864, 17240, 476, 9317, 13, 17688, 46994, 68945, 525, 5008, 31592, 13, 87148, 25777, 46994, 68945, 2578, 262, 220, 21, 17, 262, 320, 6927, 8, 315, 6623, 323, 14961, 448, 8453, 5766, 13, 4818, 4374, 7337, 1083, 15963, 5257, 50545, 82, 323, 9317, 262, 220, 21, 18, 262, 320, 3182, 8, 3281, 14431, 11568, 8453, 614, 1483, 46994, 68945, 369, 4236, 16183, 1635, 13, 8853, 4658, 29105, 862, 3607, 304, 3460, 50031, 11, 262, 220, 21, 19, 262, 320, 810, 8, 4384, 14462, 320, 115498, 8, 311, 4057, 432, 13, 6065, 882, 11, 262, 220, 21, 20, 262, 279, 7042, 13938, 11, 1251, 6009, 14376, 3607, 1119, 2613, 9666, 773, 432, 1035, 4296, 803, 6157, 13, 12098, 304, 2613, 9666, 1410, 387, 34561, 6707, 448, 4384, 14462, 892, 262, 220, 21, 21, 262, 320, 6759, 928, 8, 6519, 1119, 46994, 68945, 86833, 1251, 1744, 429, 279, 2244, 8453, 18145, 14974, 1754, 9156, 11, 262, 220, 21, 22, 262, 12163, 504, 17267, 220, 20, 20, 16, 311, 220, 19, 22, 24, 425, 727, 2572, 27061, 279, 262, 220, 21, 23, 262, 320, 15840, 8, 315, 46994, 68945, 13, 14974, 1754, 9156, 11585, 48895, 1035, 23974, 1251, 315, 47033, 323, 262, 220, 21, 24, 262, 320, 1371, 8, 2238, 16401, 369, 990, 518, 279, 1965, 6353, 453, 68945, 525, 537, 1483, 16852, 304, 13622, 13, 758, 6747, 11, 369, 3110, 11, 1429, 1251, 35242, 8180, 262, 220, 22, 15, 262, 862, 6078, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198], lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

This trend,  which  was started  by the medical  community （医学界）    61   a method  of fighting  heart  disease,  has had some  unintended  side    62    (effect)  such as overweight  and heart  disease- --the very thing  the medical  community  was trying  to fight.  Fat and salt are very important  parts  of a diet. They  are required     63    (process)  the food that we eat, to recover  from  injury  and for several  other  bodily    functions.  When  fat and salt     64     (remove)  from  food,  the food tastes  as if is missing  something.  As    65    result,  people  will eat more  food to try to make  up for that something  missing.

Later,  engineers  ____68___  (manage)  to construct  railways  in a system  of deep  tunnels  (隧道 ), which  became  known  to the tube.  This development  was only possible  with the ___69___  (introduce)  of electric-powered  engines  and lifts. The central  London  Railway  was one of the most  ___70___  (success)  of these  new lines,  and was opened  in 1900.

While  running  regularly can’t make  you live forever,  the review  says it  64 (be) more  effective  at lengthening  life  65 walking,  cycling  or swimming.  Two of the authors  of the review  also made  a study  published  in 2014   66  showed  a mere  five to 10 minutes  A day of running  reduced  the risk of heart  disease  and early  deaths  from  all  67    (cause).  The best exercise  is one that you enjoy  and will do. But otherwise…it ’s probably  running.  To avoid  knee  pain,  you can run on soft surfaces,  do exercises  to 68 (strength)  your leg muscles  (肌肉 ), avoid  hills and get good  running  shoes.  Running  is cheap,easy  and it’s always    69  (energy).  If you are time poor,  you need  run for only half the time to get the same  benefits  as other  sports,  so perhaps  we should  all give 70      a try.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, best_of=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=-1, min_p=0.0, seed=None, use_beam_search=False, length_penalty=1.0, early_stopping=False, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=512, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None), prompt_token_ids: [151644, 8948, 198, 2610, 525, 264, 10950, 17847, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 872, 198, 56568, 101909, 22574, 101057, 3837, 100638, 31838, 89012, 106367, 14582, 25, 18137, 246, 227, 57553, 100431, 99409, 96050, 107762, 44290, 68756, 17254, 220, 16, 18947, 109776, 110011, 57191, 100139, 17992, 31843, 110011, 9370, 88991, 100414, 1773, 11190, 220, 311, 264, 3395, 220, 315, 5904, 220, 304, 264, 6457, 220, 8322, 11, 220, 38280, 220, 3887, 2326, 220, 1635, 1698, 220, 21, 16, 320, 4825, 8, 1091, 2477, 22973, 4972, 13, 1446, 1513, 527, 339, 523, 5683, 359, 9349, 269, 1958, 4825, 220, 21, 17, 220, 320, 4060, 8, 220, 279, 8760, 13, 220, 1446, 1231, 7027, 11, 220, 16205, 11, 220, 387, 49154, 220, 323, 2058, 7949, 220, 697, 5214, 315, 220, 220, 21, 18, 220, 320, 26493, 8, 220, 4124, 220, 553, 4303, 13, 256, 5976, 220, 4303, 220, 15502, 646, 1405, 1281, 220, 498, 3887, 15683, 11, 220, 279, 3395, 220, 2727, 432, 220, 220, 21, 19, 320, 1371, 8, 803, 220, 7373, 220, 518, 3084, 6019, 220, 2272, 220, 220, 21, 20, 11435, 11, 220, 32062, 220, 476, 23380, 13, 220, 9043, 315, 279, 12014, 220, 315, 279, 3395, 220, 1083, 1865, 220, 264, 3920, 220, 4652, 220, 304, 220, 17, 15, 16, 19, 256, 220, 21, 21, 220, 8542, 220, 264, 17524, 220, 4236, 311, 220, 16, 15, 4420, 220, 362, 1899, 315, 4303, 220, 11046, 220, 279, 5214, 315, 4746, 220, 8457, 220, 323, 4124, 220, 16375, 220, 504, 220, 678, 220, 220, 21, 22, 262, 320, 1563, 568, 220, 576, 1850, 10158, 220, 374, 825, 429, 498, 4669, 220, 323, 686, 653, 13, 1988, 5937, 98967, 17744, 82, 4658, 220, 4303, 13, 220, 2014, 5648, 220, 21381, 220, 6646, 11, 220, 498, 646, 1598, 389, 8413, 26431, 11, 220, 653, 22932, 220, 311, 220, 21, 23, 320, 74237, 8, 220, 697, 2472, 23648, 220, 320, 105640, 6882, 5648, 220, 34131, 323, 633, 1661, 220, 4303, 220, 15294, 13, 220, 28025, 220, 374, 11872, 22563, 6405, 220, 323, 432, 748, 2677, 262, 220, 21, 24, 220, 320, 17489, 568, 220, 1416, 498, 525, 882, 7852, 11, 220, 498, 1184, 220, 1598, 369, 1172, 4279, 279, 882, 311, 633, 279, 1852, 220, 7567, 220, 438, 1008, 220, 9833, 11, 220, 773, 8365, 220, 582, 1265, 220, 678, 2968, 220, 22, 15, 414, 264, 1430, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198], lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Since  2011,  the country    61   (grow)  more  corn than rice. Corn  production  has jumped  nearly  125 percent  over   62   past 25 years,  while  rice has increased  only 7 percent.  A taste for meat  is   63   (actual)  behind  the change:  An important  part of its corn is used to feed chickens,  pigs,  and cattle.  Another  reason  for corn’s  rise: The government  encourages  farmers  to grow  corn instead  of rice   64   (improve)  water  quality.  Corn  uses less water    65   rice and creates  less fertilizer  (化肥 ) runoff.  This switch  has decreased    66   (pollute)  in the country’s  major  lakes  and reservoirs  and made  drinking  water  safer  for people.  According  to the World  Bank,  China  accounts  for about  30 percent  of total   67   (globe)  fertilizer  consumption.  The Chinese  Ministry  of Agriculture  finds  that between  2005  – when  the government    68   (start)  a soil – testing  program    69   gives  specific  fertilizer  recommendations  to farmers  – and 2011,  fertilizer  use dropped  by 7.7 million  tons.  That prevented  the emission  (排放 ) of 51.8 million  tons of carbon  dioxide.  China’s  approach  to protecting  its environment  while    70   (feed)  its citizens  “offers  useful  lessons  for agriculture  and food policymakers  worldwide,”  says the bank’s  Juergen  Voegele.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, best_of=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=-1, min_p=0.0, seed=None, use_beam_search=False, length_penalty=1.0, early_stopping=False, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=512, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None), prompt_token_ids: [151644, 8948, 198, 2610, 525, 264, 10950, 17847, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 872, 198, 56568, 101909, 22574, 101057, 3837, 100638, 31838, 89012, 106367, 14582, 25, 18137, 246, 227, 57553, 100431, 100643, 96050, 107762, 44290, 68756, 17254, 220, 16, 18947, 109776, 110011, 57191, 100139, 17992, 31843, 110011, 9370, 88991, 100414, 1773, 21685, 1415, 220, 614, 220, 5497, 220, 304, 5616, 220, 1365, 323, 773, 2238, 702, 1181, 1909, 19097, 13, 220, 8704, 220, 220, 17, 15, 16, 16, 11, 220, 279, 3146, 262, 220, 21, 16, 256, 320, 66218, 8, 220, 803, 220, 13776, 1091, 19653, 13, 21330, 220, 5670, 220, 702, 26005, 220, 7009, 220, 220, 16, 17, 20, 3266, 220, 916, 256, 220, 21, 17, 256, 3267, 220, 17, 20, 1635, 11, 220, 1393, 220, 19653, 702, 7172, 220, 1172, 220, 22, 3266, 13, 220, 362, 12656, 369, 13041, 220, 374, 256, 220, 21, 18, 256, 320, 11944, 8, 220, 4815, 220, 279, 2297, 25, 220, 1527, 2989, 220, 949, 315, 1181, 13776, 374, 1483, 311, 5395, 53523, 11, 220, 48810, 11, 220, 323, 35852, 13, 220, 13293, 220, 2874, 220, 369, 13776, 748, 220, 10000, 25, 576, 3033, 220, 36067, 220, 20336, 220, 311, 3063, 220, 13776, 4518, 220, 315, 19653, 256, 220, 21, 19, 256, 320, 318, 34463, 8, 220, 3015, 220, 4271, 13, 220, 21330, 220, 5711, 2686, 3015, 262, 220, 21, 20, 256, 19653, 323, 11450, 220, 2686, 64291, 220, 320, 112646, 873, 78052, 13, 220, 1096, 3398, 220, 702, 24938, 262, 220, 21, 21, 256, 320, 30141, 1070, 8, 220, 304, 279, 3146, 748, 220, 3598, 220, 43136, 220, 323, 44412, 82, 220, 323, 1865, 220, 16163, 220, 3015, 220, 29449, 220, 369, 1251, 13, 220, 10548, 220, 311, 279, 4337, 220, 8547, 11, 220, 5616, 220, 9618, 220, 369, 911, 220, 220, 18, 15, 3266, 220, 315, 2790, 256, 220, 21, 22, 256, 320, 70, 62997, 8, 220, 64291, 220, 15293, 13, 220, 576, 8453, 220, 19640, 220, 315, 36863, 220, 13719, 220, 429, 1948, 220, 220, 17, 15, 15, 20, 220, 1365, 979, 220, 279, 3033, 262, 220, 21, 23, 256, 320, 2468, 8, 220, 264, 17171, 1365, 7497, 220, 2025, 262, 220, 21, 24, 256, 6696, 220, 3151, 220, 64291, 220, 18564, 220, 311, 20336, 220, 1365, 323, 220, 17, 15, 16, 16, 11, 220, 64291, 220, 990, 12226, 220, 553, 220, 22, 13, 22, 3526, 220, 19608, 13, 220, 2938, 30998, 220, 279, 40253, 220, 320, 105054, 873, 315, 220, 20, 16, 13, 23, 3526, 220, 19608, 315, 12499, 220, 39489, 13, 220, 5616, 748, 220, 5486, 220, 311, 22184, 220, 1181, 4573, 220, 1393, 262, 220, 22, 15, 256, 320, 11184, 8, 220, 1181, 10283, 220, 1036, 71879, 220, 5390, 220, 18366, 220, 369, 28929, 220, 323, 3607, 69878, 220, 15245, 2419, 220, 2727, 279, 6073, 748, 220, 21671, 2375, 268, 220, 647, 4644, 709, 273, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198], lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.
