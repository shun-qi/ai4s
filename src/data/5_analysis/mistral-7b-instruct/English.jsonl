But other  ways,  like talking  to someone  you trust,  can lead you to solving  your problem  or at least feeling  better.  Try taking  these  four steps.  the next time you are stressed:  (1) Get support.  When  you need  help,  reach  out to the people  who care about  you. Talk to a trusted  adult,  such as a parent  or other  relatives.    72    They  might  have  had similar  problems,  such as dealing  with a test, or the death  of a beloved  pet. (2) Don’t take it out on yourself.  Sometimes  when  kids are stressed  and upset  they take it out on themselves.  Oh, dear,  that’s not a good  idea.  Remember  that there    are always  people  to help you. Don’t take it out on yourself.    73    (3) Try to solve  the problem.  After  you’re calm  and you have  support  from  adults  and friends,  it’s time to get down  to business.    74    Even  if you can’t solve  it all, you can solve  a piece  of it. (4) Be positive.  Most  stress  is temporary  (暂时的 ). Remember  stress  does go away,  especially  when  you figure  out the problem  and start working  on solving  it.  These  steps  aren’t magic,  but they do work.  And if you can stay positive  as you you’re  your way through  a tough  time,  you’ll help yourself  feel better  even  faster.    75    A. Ask for a helping  hand  to get you through  the tough  situation.  B. Notice  your friends ’ feelings  and find a way to help them.  C. Different  people  feel stress  in different  ways.  D. Ah, it feels  so good  when  the stress  is gone.  E. You need  to figure  out what  the problem  is. F. And don’t forget  about  your friends.  G.

So today  I want  to give you some  wisdom  about  how to make  the most  of the time you spend  in the kitchen . Here  are three  tips for great  cooking  on a tight schedule : ①Think  ahead . The moments  when  I think  cooking  is a pain are when  I’m already  hungry  and there  is nothing  ready  to eat. So think  about  of the coming  week . When  will you have  time to cook ? Do you have  the right  materials  ready ? 　 37  　 ②Make  your time worth  it. When  you do find time to cook  a meal , make  the most  of it and save yourself  time later on. Are you making  one loaf of bread ? 　 38  　 it takes  around  the same  amount  of time to make  more  of something . So save yourself  the effort  for a future  meal . ③　 39  　 This may surprise  you, but one of the best tools  for making  cooking  worth  your time is experimentation . It gives  you the chance  to hit upon  new ideas  and recipes  that can work  well with your appetite  and schedule . The more  you learn  and the more  you try, the more  ability  you have  to take control  of your food and your schedule . Hopefully  that gives  you a good  start. 　 40  　 and don’t let a busy  schedule  discourage  you from  making  some  great  changes  in the way you eat and live!   A. Try new things  B.

Banks,  companies,  and government  agencies  use secret  codes  in doing  business,  especially  when  information  is sent by computer.  People  have  used secret  codes  for thousands  of years.     36    Code  breaking  never  lags (落后 ) far behind  code  making.  The science  of creating  and reading  coded  messages  is called  cryptography.  There  are three  main  types  of cryptography.     37    For example,  the first letters  of “My elephant  eats too many  eels”  spell out the hidden  message  “Meet  me.”     38    You might  represent  each letter  with a number,  for example.  Let’s  number  the letters  of the alphabet,  in order,  from  1 to 26. If we substitute  a number  for each letter,  the message  “Meet  me” would  read “13 5 5 20 13 5.” A code  uses symbols  to replace  words,  phrases,  or sentences.  To read the message  of a real code,  you must  have  a code  book.     39    For example,  “bridge”  might  stand  for “meet”  and “out”  might  stand  for “me.”  The message    “Bridge  out” would  actually  mean  “Meet  me.”     40    However,  it is also hard to keep  a code  book  secret  for long.  So codes  must  be changed  frequently.  A. It is very hard to break  a code  without  the code  book.  B. In any language,  some  letters  are used more  than others.  C. Only  people  who know  the keyword  can read the message.  D. As long as there  have  been  codes,  people  have  tried to break  them.  E. You can hide a message  by having  the first letters  of each word  spell  it out. F. With  a code  book,  you might  write  down  words  that would  stand  for other  words.  G.

They’re  the little spots  of color  like throw  pillows,  mirrors  and baskets  that most  of us use to add visual  interest  to our rooms.  Less tiring  than painting  your walls  and less expensive  than buying  a colorful  sofa,  small  color  choices  bring  with them  the significant  benefit  of being  easily  changeable.  Medium  color  choices  are generally  furniture  pieces  such  as sofas , dinner  tables  or bookshelves     39   . They  require  a bigger  commitment  than smaller  ones , and they have  a more  powerful  effect  on the feeling  of a space.  The large  color  decisions  in your  rooms  concern  the walls , ceilings , and floors . Whether  you’re looking  at wallpaper  or paint , the time, effort  and relative  expense  put into it are significant .    40   . A. While  all of them  are useful   B.

(所以最主要的事情就是去尝试，去冒险，尝试不同的食物，和陌生人交谈)”可推知，本段主要说明想在晚宴上让自己变得有趣，就要勇于冒险，勇于探索。由此可知，B项“The first step is to go exploring(第一步是去探索)”承上启下，符合题意。故选B项。【37题详解】根据下文“it can bring in “I have this old, broken-down vehicle” or “I rode the bus with these crazy people who were laughing at silly jokes in the back.” It just opens up conversation. (它可以带入“我有这辆破旧的车”或“我和那些在后面嘲笑愚蠢笑话的疯子一起乘坐公共汽车。”它只是打开了对话)”可知，设空处应该是提了一个不太好的问题，只是开始交流，但并不会给人留下有趣的印象。由此可知，C项“If you ask the question “How did you get here?”(如果你问“你是怎么到这里来的？”这个问题)”能够承接下文，符合题意。故选C项。【38题详解】根据下文“If you can’t take their wine away, you should certainly try to take away their soapbox. If you’re the host, you can ask them to help you in the kitchen with something and just remove them from the situation. (如果你不能拿走他们的酒，你当然应该让他们离开讲话的地方。如果你是主人，你可以让他们到厨房帮你做点什么，只是为了让他们摆脱那种情景)”可知，此处指出了一个问题的解决办法。由此推知，设空处提到了一个棘手的问题。F项“What about the person who has had too much to drink or won’t stop talking(喝太多酒或一直说个不停的人怎么办)”正是提出的问题，引出下文的解决办法，符合题意。故选F项。【39题详解】根据上文“If you can’t take their wine away, you should certainly try to take away their soapbox (讲台). If you’re the host, you can ask them to help you in the kitchen with something and just remove them from the situation. (如果你不能拿走他们的酒，你当然应该让他们离开讲话的地方。如果你是主人，你可以让他们到厨房帮你做点什么，只是为了让他们摆脱那种情景)”可知，本段主要是为解决“喝太多酒或一直说个不停”这个问题提供方法。由此可知，E项“Or turn the conversation into a topic where they have little to say(或者把谈话变成他们没什么可说的话题)”是提出的另一个解决办法，承接上文，符合题意。故选E项。【40题详解】根据上文“If you’re faced with an awkward silence at a dinner party, the only thing that always gets everyone talking again is to give the host a compliment.(如果你在晚宴上遭遇了尴尬的沉默，唯一能让大家再次交谈的方法就是赞美主人)”可知，此处指出赞美主人可以缓解尴尬的沉默，设空处承上启下，下文“This cake is extremely delicious and you have to tell me all about it.(这蛋糕特别好吃，你得告诉我它的一切)”对主人进行了赞美。由此可知，宴会上出现尴尬的沉默时，最尴尬的就是主人，所以需要赞美主人来缓解尴尬。G项“He or she is the person who is feeling the weight of that awkwardness the most(他或她是最能感受到那种尴尬的人)”承上启下，符合题意。故选G项", "modality": "t", "image_urls": [], "inference": "{\n\"type\":\"概念题\",\n\"analysis\":[\n[\"解法一\",\"选项A是指向主题（主人）的问题，并不能帮助参与者展现自己的兴趣，因此不是最佳选项。\"],\n[\"解法二\",\"选项C是指向主题（主人）的问题，并不能帮助参与者展现自己的兴趣，因此不是最佳选项。\"],\n[\"解法三\",\"选项D是指向主题（陌生人）的问题，并不能帮助参与者展现自己的兴趣，因此不是最佳选项。\"],\n[\"解法四\",\"选项E是指向主题（陌生人）的问题，并不能帮助参与者展现自己的兴趣，因此不是最佳选项。\"],\n[\"解法五\",\"选项F是指向主题（陌生人）的问题，并不能帮助参与者展现自己的兴趣，因此不是最佳选项。\"],\n[\"解法六\",\"选项G是指向主题（陌生人）的问题，并不能帮助参与者展现自己的兴趣，因此不是最佳选项。\"],\n[\"解法七\",\"选项B是指向主题（自己）的问题，并且提倡参与者在陌生环境中展现自己的勇气和探索性，因此是最佳选项。\"],\n[\"解法八\",\"选项H是指向主题（陌生人）的问题，并且提倡参与者在陌生环境中展现自己的勇气和探索性，因此也是最佳选项。\"]\n],\n\"answer\":\"B\"\n}\n\n{\n\"type\":\"概念题\",\n\"analysis\":[\n[\"解法一\",\"选项A是指向主题（主人）的问题，并不能帮助参与者展现自己的兴趣，因此不是最佳选项。\"],\n[\"解法二\",\"选项C是指向主题（主人）的问题，并不能帮助参与者展现自己的兴趣，因此不是最佳选项。\"],\n[\"解法三\",\"选项D是指向主题（陌生人）的问题，并不能帮助参与者展现自己的兴趣，因此不是最佳选项。\"],\n[\"解法四\",\"选项E是指向主题（陌生人）的问题，并不能帮助参与者展现自己的兴趣，因此不是最佳选项。\"],\n[\"解法五\",\"选项F是指向主题（陌生人）的问题，并不能帮助参与者展现自己的兴趣，因此不是最佳选项。\"],\n[\"解法六\",\"选项G是指向主题（陌生人）的问题，并不能帮助参与者展现自己的兴趣，因此不是最佳选项。\"],\n[\"解法七\",\"选项H是指向主题（陌生人）的问题，并且提倡参与者在陌生环境中展现自己的勇气和探索性，因此也是最佳选项。\"]\n],\n\"answer\":\"H\"\n}\n\n{\n\"type\":\"概念题\",\n\"analysis\":[\n[\"解法一\",\"选项A是指向主题（主人）的问题，并不能帮助参与者展现自己的兴趣，因此不是最佳选项。\"],\n[\"解法二\",\"选项B是指向主题（自己）的问题，并且提倡参与者在陌生环境中展现自己的勇气和探索性，因此是最佳选项。\"],\n[\"解法三\",\"选项C是指向主题（主人）的问题，并不能帮助参与者展现自己的兴", "rating": "{ \"is_correct\": false, \"correctness_score\": 0, \"completeness_score\": 0, \"innovation_score\": 0, \"reasoning_score\": 0, \"student_level\": \"小学\"}"}

Maybe you say “go,” or turn on a certain song, or whatever.”（设置开始时间。也许你说“开始”，或者打开一首歌，或者无论什么。）打开音乐或者无论什么，意味聚会开始。下文“And don't forget to put out some cookies and fruits. Remember, it's a party!”（别忘了拿出一些饼干和水果。记住，这是个派对！）讲到了聚会上应该提供一些派对该有的服务。因而，空白处应是承接上文，讲述聚会期间要保持应有的内容。D项“Just keep music playing throughout.”（要始终播放音乐。）承上启下，说明在派对上要有音乐，与前文形成意义上的一致，符合题意，故选D项。", "modality": "t", "image_urls": [], "inference": "{\n\"type\":\"概念题\",\n\"analysis\":[\n[\"解法一\",\"选项A: Less people than that。因为题目要求邀请5-10人，而A选项表示邀请的人数比这些人数少，所以A选项是最佳选项。\"],\n[\"解法二\",\"选项G: Tell everyone to bring clean clothes in good condition。因为题目要求参与者都是朋友，而且是在交换衣服，所以参与者都应该带来干净、好条件的衣服，所以G选项是最佳选项。\"],\n[\"解法三\",\"选项H: Everyone must try on the clothes before they take them。因为题目提到了一条 swap 的规则，即每个人必须试着穿衣服，所以H选项是最佳选项。\"],\n[\"解法四\",\"选项I: Put out some cookies and fruits。因为题目提到了 swap 是一个 party，所以应该有些零食和水果供参与者享用，所以I选项是最佳选项。\"]\n],\n\"answer\":\"A, G, H, I\"\n}", "rating": "{\"is_correct\": false, \"correctness_score\": 0, \"completeness_score\": 2, \"innovation_score\": 1, \"reasoning_score\": 2, \"student_level\": \"初中/高中\"}"}

(知道一些技巧将有助于确保你和朋友或家人一起享受一顿愉快的晚餐——无论你在世界的哪个地方)”。故选D。【17题详解】根据本段小标题“Chopstick Rules”可知，本段主要讲述的是使用筷子的规则。根据上文“When you put them down between bites, always put them down together so they are parallel with the edge of the table in front of you. (当你在吃的间隙把它们放下来的时候，一定要把它们放在一起，这样它们就和你面前的桌子边缘平行了)”可知，此处讲述了正确使用筷子的方式。由此可知，F项“Never stick them upright in your food or cross them as you use them (不要把它们笔直地插在你的食物中，也不要在使用它们时交叉放置)”讲述的也是使用筷子时的注意事项，符合此处语境，其中“them”指的是上文的“chopsticks”。故选F。【18题详解】根据本段小标题“Hands or Utensils (餐具)”可知，本段主要讲述的是手和餐具的问题。根据上文“In India and the Middle East, it’s considered very rude to eat with your left hand. People in France expect you to eat with a utensil in each hand. (在印度和中东，用左手吃饭被认为是非常不礼貌的。法国人希望你每只手拿一个餐具吃饭)”及下文“instead preferring to use their hands (相反更愿意使用他们的双手)”可知，此处在讲述不同国家就餐时习惯使用哪只手的问题。由此可知，C项“Mexicans consider it inappropriate to eat with utensils (墨西哥人认为用餐具吃饭是不合适的)”符合语境，与下文形成转折关系。故选C。【19题详解】根据本段小标题“Making Requests”可知，本段主要讲述的是用餐时提请求的问题。根据下文“In Portugal, this would be a serious mistake, because it shows the chef that you don’t like their seasoning skills. Similarly, in Italy, never ask for extra cheese to add to your food. (在葡萄牙，这将是一个严重的错误，因为这向厨师表明你不喜欢他们的调味技巧。同样，在意大利，永远不要要求在食物中添加额外的奶酪)”可推知，在一些国家，用餐时提出要求是很无礼的。由此可知，G项“It may seem like simple request to ask for salt and pepper at a meal (吃饭时要盐和胡椒看似很简单)”符合此处语境，其中“request”是关键词，说明，在用餐时提出一些我们看来很平常的要求在某些国家是无礼的。故选G。【20题详解】根据下文“the more comfortable you’ll begin to feel with its foreign cultural practices. (你就会对它的外国文化习俗感到越舒服)”可推知，此处指在一个国家待得越久，就会越习惯当地习俗，且此处是“the+比较级，the+比较级”结构，B项“The more time you spend in any given country (你在某个国家待的时间越长)”符合文意，引出下文。故选B。", "modality": "t", "image_urls": [], "inference": "{\n\"type\":\"概念题\",\n\"analysis\":[\n\t[\"选项A是指建立更多的朋友，因为在不同国家的餐厅中遵循不同的礼节可以帮助你与朋友和家人一起享受美食。\"],\n\t[\"选项B是指在不同国家度过更多的时间，因为在不同国家遵循不同的礼节可以帮助你更加适应该国的文化习惯。\"],\n\t[\"选项C是错误的，因为在墨西哥，使用餐具被认为是不适当的。\"],\n\t[\"选项D是错误的，因为在餐厅中做出愚蠢的错误是不可取的。\"],\n\t[\"选项E是错误的，因为在餐厅中做出愚蠢的错误是不可取的。\"],\n\t[\"选项F是错误的，因为在餐厅中做出愚蠢的错误是不可取的。\"],\n\t[\"选项G是错误的，因为在餐厅中要求添加咖喱是在葡萄牙和意大利不可取的，因为这表明你不喜欢厨师的调味技巧。\"],\n\t[\"选项G是错误的，因为在餐厅中要求添加咖喱是在葡萄牙和意大利不可取的，因为这表明你不喜欢厨师的调味技巧。\"],\n\t[\"选项H是正确的，因为在不同国家遵循不同的礼节可以帮助你更加适应该国的文化习惯。\"]\n],\n\"answer\":\"选项H\"\n}", "rating": "{\"is_correct\": false, \"correctness_score\": 0, \"completeness_score\": 2, \"innovation_score\": 1, \"reasoning_score\": 2, \"student_level\": \"初中/高中\"}"}

Any owner  will tall you how much  joy a pet brings . For some , an animal  provides  more  comfort  than a husband/wife .

Never  mind  that Beijing ’s dry weather  seldom  produces  snow . It is cold enough  in winter  for snow  --- making  machines  to make  a covering  for the hills north  to the capital . And the rapid  growth  of a pleasure  --- seeking  middle  class  has formed  the basis  for this new craze（热潮） .  Since  Beijing ’s first ski resort  was opened  ten years  ago, the sport  has enjoyed  astonishing  increase . There  are now more  than a dozen  resorts . Clothes  markets  in the city have  added  bright  colored  ski suits to their winter  collections . Mr. Wei, a manager  of a newly -opened  ski resort  in Beijing , sees the growth  of an industry  that could  soon  lead Chinese  to head  for the ski resorts  of Europe . In recent  years  ski resorts  offering  natural  snow  have  opened  in China . But many  are in faraway  areas  of the country  and can’t really  match  the equipment  and services  of some  ski resorts  in Europe .  Beijing ’s skiing  craze  is partly  a result  of the recent  increase  in private（私有的） cars. This has led to the growth  of a leisure  industry  in the capital ’s suburbs（郊区）, which  until the late-1990s  were  unreachable  to ordinary  people . According  to Mr.  Wei, about  40% of the visitors  to his resort  come  in their own cars. The rest are bused  in by schools , businesses  or government  offices .  The problem  is making  money . Starting  ski resorts  requires  quite  a lot of money ;  hiring  land from  the local  government , preparing  the hills, buying  snow  machines , making  sure there  are enough  water  and electricity  to run them , and buying  ski equipment  for hiring  out to customers .  The ski resort  where  Mr. Wei works  cost nearly  $4m to set up. And as so often  in China  when  someone  comes  up with a good  idea, many  others  hash in and price  wars  break  out. Beijing  now offers  some  of the cheapest  ski training  classes  in the world , though  with most  people  rather  new to the sport , expecting  a few more  doing  the same    job.  50.

Things  to be considered  when  starting  a ski resort .  D. A sudden  increase  of ski training  classes  in Beijing .  51. Why  are some  Chinese  likely  to go skiing  in Europe？　   　 A. To visit more  ski areas .              B. To ski on natural  snow .  C. For a large  collection  of ski suits.      D. For better  services  and equipment .  52. The underlined  words  “leisure  industry ” in Paragraph  3 refer  to　   　 A. transport  to ski resorts                B. production  of family  cars C. business  of providing  spare  time enjoyments  D part-time work  for people  living  in the suburbs  53. What  is the main  problem  in running  a ski resort？　   　 A. Difficulty  in hiring  land.            B. Lack  of business  experience .  C. Price  wars  with other  ski resorts .      D.

All we assume（推测） is that some  early  men invented  certain  sounds , in one way or another , to express  thoughts  and feelings , actions  and things , so that they could  talk with each other . Later  they agreed  upon  certain  signs , called  letters , which  could  be put together  to show  those  sounds , and which  could  be written  down . Those  sounds , whether  spoken  or written  in letters , are called  words .  The power  of words , then, lies in their associations ---the things  they bring  up to our minds . Words  become  filled  with meaning  for us by experience ; and the longer  we tire, the more  certain  words  bring  back  to us the happy  and sad events  of our past; and the more  we read and learn , the more  the number  of words  that mean  something  to us increases .

An animal  that is aware（意识）of itself  has a high level  of intelligence .   Awareness  can be tested  by studying  whether  the animal  recognizes  itself  in the mirror , that is, its own reflected  image（反射出的影像） . Many  animals  fail this exercise  bitterly , paying  very little attention  to the reflected  image . Only  humans , and some  intelligent  animals  like apes and dolphins , have  shown  to recognize  that the image  in the mirror  is of themselves . Now  another  animal  has joined  the club. In the Proceedings  of the National  Academy  of Sciences , researchers  report  that an Asian  elephant  has passed  the mirror  self-reflection  test. “We thought  that elephants  were  the next important  animal ,” said Dinana  Reiss  of the Wildlife  Conservation  Society , an author  of the study  with Joshua  M. Plotnik  and Fans  B.M. de Waal  of Emory  University . With  their large  brains , Reiss  said, elephants  “seemed  like cousins  to apes and dolphins .” The researchers  tested  Happy , Maxine  and Patty , three  elephants  at the Bronx  Zoo. They  put an 8-foot-square  mirror  on a wall of the animals ’ play area（out of the sight  of zoo visitors）and recorded  what  happened  with cameras , including  one built in the mirror . The elephants  used their long noses  to find what  was behind  it, and to examine  parts  of their bodies . Of the three , Happy  then passed  the test, in which  a clear  mark  was painted  on one side of her face. She could  tell the mark  was there  by looking  in the mirror , and she used the mirror  to touch  the mark  with her long nose. Diana  Reiss  said, “We knew  elephants  were  intelligent , but now we can talk about  their intelligence  in a better  way.” 45. What  can mirror  tests tell us about  animals ? 　   　 A. Whether  they have  large  brains . B. Whether  they have  self-awareness . C. Whether  they enjoy  outdoor  exercises . D. Whether  they enjoy  playing  with mirrors . 46.

They  are included  in the study  by Reiss . D. They  are already  known  to be intelligent . 47. What  made  Happy  different  from  Maxine  and Patty ? 　   　 A.

I received  a letter  from  the head  of the Personnel  Department  that started , “Dear  John , I am quite  pleased  that you have  decided  to join us.” That “quite ” saddened  me. I thought  he was saying  “we’re kind of pleased  you decided  to join us although  I wish  we had hired  someone  else.” Then  I discovered  that in American  English  “quite ” sometimes  means  “very”, while  in British  English  it means  “fairly ”. So the first lesson  about  working  in other  countries  is to learn  the language  and by that I don’t just mean  the words  people  speak . It is body  language , dress , manners , ideas  and so on. The way people  do things  highlights  many  of the differences  we see between  cultures（文化） . Some  of these  differences  may be only on the surface  --- dress , food and hours  of work  --- while  others  may be deeper  and take longer  to deal with. Mostly , it is just a question  of getting  used to the differences  and accepting  them , like the climate（气候）, while  getting  on with business . Some  of the differences  may be an improvement . People  are more  polite ; the   service  is better ; you ask for something  to be done  and it happens  without  having  to ask again . However , other  differences  can be troubling , like punctuality （准时） . If you invite  people  to a party  at 7 o’clock  your guests  will consider  it polite  to turn up exactly  on time in Germany , five minutes  early  in the American  Midwest , an hour early  in Japan , 15 minutes  afterwards  in the UK, up to an hour afterwards  in Italy and some  time in the evening  in Greece . I prefer  not to use the word  “late” because  there  is nothing  wrong  with the times  people  arrive . It is simply  the accepted  thing  to do in their own country . 52. The author  was unhappy  as mentioned  in Paragraph  1 because  he thought  　   . A. the American  bank  didn’t think  much  of him B. the American  bank  might  hire another  person  C. it’s difficult  to get used to American  culture  D. it’s easy to misunderstand  Americans  53.

Do things  in our own way.          D. Do in-depth  research . 55. When  invited  to a party  the people  who are usually  punctual  are　   　. A. Italians       B. Germans       C.

His name  was Mr. Basille.  He wore  a white  cap and drove  a white  truck.  As a 5-year-old  boy, I couldn’t  take my eyes off the coin changer  fixed  to his belt. He noticed  this one day during  a delivery  and gave  me a quarter  out of his coin changer.  Of course,  he delivered  more  than milk.  There  was cheese,  eggs and so on. If we needed  to change  our order,  my mother  would  pen a note- --“Please  add a bottle  of buttermilk  next delivery”- --and place  it in the box along  with the empty  bottles.  And then,  the buttermilk  would  magically  appear.  All of this was about  more  than convenience.  There  existed  a close  relationship  between  families  and their milkmen.  Mr. Basille  even  had a key to out house,  for those  times  when  it was so cold outside  that we put the box indoors,  so that the milk wouldn’t  freeze.  And I remember  Mr. Basille  from  time to time taking  a break  at our kitchen  table,  having  a cup of tea and telling  stories  about  his delivery.  There  is sadly  no home  milk delivery  today.  Big companies  allowed  the production  of cheaper  milk,  thus making  it difficult  for milkmen  to compete.  Besides,  milk is for sale everywhere,  and it may just not have  been  practical  to have  a delivery  service.  Recently,  an old milk box in the countryside  I saw brought  back  my childhood  memories.  I took it home  and planted  it on the back  porch(门廊 ). Every  so often  my son’s  friends  will ask what  it is. So I start telling  stories  of my boyhood,  and of the milkman  who brought  us friendship  along  with his milk.  56. Mr. Basille  gave  the boy a quarter  out of his coin changer  _______.  A. to show  his magical  power       B. to pay for the delivery       C. to satisfy  his curiosity           D. to please  his mother  57. What  can be inferred  from  the fact that the milkman  had the key to the boy’s  house?  A. He wanted  to have  tea there.            B. He was a respectable  person.  C. He was treated  as a family  member.      D. He was fully  trusted  by the family.  58. Why  does home  milk delivery  no longer  exist?  A. Nobody  wants  to be a milkman  now.     B. It has been  driven  out of the market.  C. Its service  is getting  poor.              D. It is forbidden  by law. 59. Why  did the author  bring  back  home  an old milk box?  A.

Throughout  history , advertising  has been  all effective  way to promote（促进） the trading  and selling  of goods . In the Middle  Ages , merchants  employed  “town  criers ” to read public  messages  aloud  to promote  their goods . When  printing  was invented  in the fifteenth  century , pages  of advertisements  （ads）could  be printed  easily  and were  either  hung  in public  places  or put in books .  By the end of the seventeenth  century , when  newspapers  were  beginning  to be read by more  people , printed  materials  became  all important  way to promote  products  and services . The London  Gazette  was the first newspaper  to set aside  a place  just for advertising . This was so successful  that by the end of the century  several  companies  started  businesses  for the purpose  of making  newspaper  ads for merchants . Advertising  spread  quickly  throughout  the eighteenth  century . Ad writers  were  starting  to pay more  attention  to the design  of the ad text.

The Tall Persons  Club  Great  Britain  (TPCGB),  which  was formed  six months  ago to campaign  for the needs  of the tall, has turned  its attention  to hotels  and restaurants.  Beds  that are too small,  shower  heads  that are too low, and restaurant  tables  with hardly  any leg-room  all make  life difficult  for those  of above  average    height,  it says.  But it is not just the extra-tall  whose  needs  are not being  met. The average  night  of the population  has been  increasing  ye the standard  size of beds,  doorways,  and chairs  has remained  unchanged.  “The  bedding  industry  says a bed should  be six inches  larger  than the person  using  it, so even  a king-size  bed at 6′6″(6  feet and 6 inches)  is falling  short  for 25% of men,  while  the standard  6′3″ bed caters  for less than half of the male  population.”  said TPCGB  president  Phil Heinricy,  “seven-foot  beds would  work  fine.”  Similarly,  restaurant  tables  can cause  no end of problems.  Small  tables,  which  mean  the long-legged  have  to sit a foot or so away  from  them,  are enough  to make  tall customers  go elsewhere.  Some  have  already  taken  note,  however.  At Queens  Moat  Houses′  Caledonian  Hotel  in Edinburgh,  6′6″beds  are now put in as standard  after requests  for longer  beds from  taller  visitors,  particularly  Americans.  64. What  is the purpose  of the TPCGB  campaign?  A. To provide  better  services.             B. To rebuild  hotels  and restaurants.  C. To draw  public  attention  to the needs  of the tall.   D. To attract  more  people  to become  its members.  65. Which  of the following  might  be a bed of proper  length  according  to Phil Heinricy?  A . 7′2″        B. 7′        C. 6′6″        D. 6′3″ 66. What  may happen  to restaurants  with small  tables?  A. They  may lose some  customers.                B. They  may start businesses  elsewhere.  C. They  have  to find easy chairs  to match  the tables.   D. They  have  to provide  enough  space  for the long-legged.  67.

So this year she did something  more  than a hobby:  She planted  vegetables  in her yard.  For her fist garden,  Ms Feeley  has put in 15 tomato  plants,  and five rows  of a variety  of vegetables.  The family’s  old farm  house  has become  a chicken  house,  its residents  arriving  next month.  Last year,  Ms. Rita Gartin  kept a small  garden.  This year she has made  it much  larger  because,  she said, “The  cost of everything  is going  up and I was looking  to lose a few pounds  too; so it’s a win-win  situation  all around.”  They  are among  the growing  number  of Americans  who,  driven  by higher  living  costs  and a falling  economy  (经济 ), have  taken  up vegetable  gardening  for the first time.  Others  have  increased  the size of their existing  gardens.  Seed  companies  and garden  shops  say no since  the 1970s  have  there  been  such an increase  in interest  in growing  food at home.  Now  many  gardens  across  the country  have  been  sold out for several  months.  In Austin,  Tex, some  of the gardens  have  a three-year  waiting  list. George  C. Ball Jr, owner  of a company,  said sales  of vegetable  seeds  and plants  are up by 40%,  over last year,  double  the average  growth  of last five years.  Mr. Ball argues  that some  of the reasons  have  been  building  for the last few years.  The big one is striking  use in me cost on food like bread  and milk,  together  with the increases  in the price  of fruit and vegetables.  Food  prices  have  increase  of higher  oil price.  People  are driving  less, taking  fewer  vacations,  so there  more  time to garden.  68. What  does the word  “residents”  in Paragraph  1 probably  refer  to?

Most  people,  and many  animals,  like eating  it. However,  the only way for them  to get that honey  is to find a wild bees’ nest and take the honey  from  it. Often,  these  nests  are high up in trees,  and it is difficult  to find them.  In parts  of Africa,  though,  people  and animals  looking  for honey  have  a strange  and unexpected  helper  --- a little bird called  a honey  guide.  The honey  guide  does not actually  like honey,  but it does like the wax in the beehives  (蜂房 ). The little bird cannot  reach  this wax,  which  is deep  inside  the bees’ nest. So, when  it finds  a suitable  nest, it looks  for someone  to help it. The honey  guide  gives  a loud cry that attracts  the attention  of both passing  animals  and people.  Once  it has their attention,  it flies through  the forest,  waiting  from  time to time for the curious  animal  or person  as it leads  them  to the nest. When  they finally  arrive  at the nest, the follower  reaches  in to get at the delicious  honey  as the bird patiently  waits  and watches.  Some  of the honey,  and the wax,  always  falls to the ground,  and this is when  the honey  guide  takes  its share.  Scientists  do not know  why the honey  guide  likes  eating  the wax,  but it is very determined  in its efforts  to get it. The birds  seem  to be able to smell  wax from  a long distance  away.  They  will quickly  arrive  whenever  a beekeeper  is taking  honey  from  his beehives,  and will even  enter  churches  when  beeswax  candles  are being  lit. 60. Why  is it difficult  to find a wild bees’ nest?  A. It’s small  in size.        B. It’s hidden  in trees.  C. It’s covered  with wax.     D. It’s hard to recognize.  61. What  do the words  “the follower ” in Paragraph  2 refer  to? A. A bee.    B. A bird.    C. A honey  seeker.     D. A beekeeper.    62. The honey  guide  is special  in the way _______ .

{"year": "2012", "id": "2010-2022_English_Reading_Comp", "category": "（新课标）", "subject": "English", "type": "SCQ", "assessmentType": "objective", "index": 23, "score": 2, "input": "D Grown-ups  are often  surprised  by how well they remember  something  they learned  as children  but have  never  practiced  ever since.  A man who has not had a chance  to go swimming  for years  can still swim  as well as ever when  he gets back  in the water.  He can get on a bicycle  after many  years  and still ride away.  He can play catch  and hit a ball as well as his son. A mother  who has not thought  about  the words  for years  can teach  her daughter  the poem  that begins  “Twinkle,  twinkle,  little star” or remember  the story  of Cinderella  or Goldilocks  and the Three  Bears.  One explanation  is the law of overlearning , which  can be stated  as follows:  Once  we have  learned  something,  additional  learning  trials  increase  the length  of time we will remember  it.                                 In childhood  we usually  continue  to practice  such skills  as swimming,  bicycle  riding,  and playing  baseball  long after we have  learned  them.  We continue  to listen  to and remind  ourselves  of words  such as “Twinkle,  twinkle,  little star” and childhood  tales such as Cinderella  and Goldilocks.  We not only learn  but overlearn.  The multiplication  tables  (乘法口诀表 ) are an exception  to the general  rule that we forget  rather  quickly  the things  that we learn  in school,  because  they are another  of the things  we overlearn  in childhood.  The law of overlearning  explains  why cramming  (突击学习 ) for an examination,  though  it may result  in a passing  grade,  is not a satisfactory  way to learn  a college  course.  By cramming,  a student  may learn  the subject  well enough  to get by on the examination,  but he is likely  soon  to forget  almost  everything  he learned.  A little   overlearning,  on the other  hand,  is really  necessary  for one’s future  development.  67. What  is the main  idea of Paragraph  1? A. People  remember  well what  they learned  in childhood.  B. Children  have  a better  memory  than grown-ups.  C. Poem  reading  is a good  way to learn  words.  D. Stories  for children  are easy to remember.  68. The author  explains  the law of overlearning  by _______.  A. presenting  research  findings    B. setting  down  general  rules  C. making  a comparison         D. using  examples  69. According  to the author,  being  able to use multiplication  tables  is _______.

They  don’t listen  because  they already  know  it all. I was lucky:  I became  a pilot in 1970,  almost  ten years  before  I graduated  from  medical  school.  I didn’t realize  then,  but becoming  a pilot makes  me a better  surgeon.  I loved  flying.  As I flew bigger,  faster  planes,  and in worse  weather.  I learned  about  crew  resource  management  (机组资源管理 ), or CRM,  a new idea to make  flying  safer.  It means  that crew  members  should  listen  and speak  up for a good  result,  regardless  of positions.  I first read about  CRM  in 1980.  Not long after that, an attending  doctor  and I were  flying  in bad weather.  The controller  had us turn too late to get our landing  ready.  The attending  doctor  was flying;  I was safety  pilot He was so busy  because  of the bad turn, he had forgotten  to put the landing  gear (起落架 ) down.  He was a better  pilot --- and my boss --- so it felt unusual  to speak  up. But I had to: Our lives  were  in danger.  I put aside  my uneasiness  and said, “We need  to put the landing  gear down  now! ” That was my first real lesson  in the power  of CRM,  and I’ve used it in the operating  room  ever since.  CRM  requires  that the pilot/surgeon  encourage  others  to speak  up. It further  requires  that when  opinions  are from  the opposite,  the doctor  doesn ’t overreact,  which  might  prevent  fellow  doctors  from  voicing  opinions  again.  So when  I’m in the operating  room,  I ask for ideas  and help from  others.  Sometimes  they’re not willing  to speak  up. But I hope  that if I continue  to encourage  them,  someday  someone  will keep  me from  “landing  gear up”. 56. What  dose the author  say about  doctors  in general?  A. They  like flying  by themselves.     B. They  are unwilling  to take advice.  C. They  pretend  to be good  pilots.     D. They  are quick  learners  of CRM.  57. The author  deepened  his understanding  of the power  of CRM  when_______.    A. he saved  the plane  by speaking  up    B. he was in charge  of a flying  task C. his boss landed  the plane  too late     D. his boss operated  on a patient  58.

Eight  theatre  groups  turned  up uninvited  in 1947,  in the belief  that everyone  should  have  the right  to perform,  and they did so in a public  house  disused  for years.  Soon,  groups  of studentsfirstly  from  Edinburgh  University,  and later from  the universities  of Oxford  and Cambridge,  Durham  and Birmingham  were  making  the journey  to the Scottish  capital  each summer  to perform  theatre  by little-known  writers  of plays  in small  church  halls  to the people  of Edinburgh.  Today  the “Fringe”,  once  less recognized,  has far outgrown  the festival  with around  1,500  performances  of theatre,  music  and dance  on every  one of the 21 days it lasts.  And yetas  early  as 1959,  with only 19 theatre  groups  performing,  some  said it was getting  too big.

Or do newborns  simply  prefer  more  to fewer?  The same  experiment,  but with three  spots  shown  before  two, shows  the same  return  of interest  when  the number  of spots  changes.  Perhaps  it is just the newness?  When  slightly  older  babies  were  shown  cards  with pictures  of objects  (a comb,  a key, an orange  and so on), changing  the number  of objects  had an effect  separate  from  changing  the objects  themselves.

I was telling  someone  how much  I had enjoyed  reading  Barack  Obama’s  Dreams  From  My Father  and how it had changed  my views  of our President.  A friend  I was talking  to agreed  with me that it was, in his words,  “a brilliantly （精彩地） written  book”.  however,  he then went  on to talk abour  Mr. Obama  in a way which  suggested  he had no idea of his background  at all. I sensed  that I was talking  to a book  liar. And it seems  that my friend  is not the only one. Approximately  two thirds  of people  have  lied about  reading  a book  which  they haven’t.  In the World  Book  Day’s  “Report  on Guilty  Secrets”,  Dreams  From  My Father  is at number  9. The report  lists ten books,  and various  authors,  which  people  have  lied about  reading,  and as I’m not one to lie too often  (I’d hate to be caught  out ), I’ll admit  here and now that I haven’t  read the entire  top ten. But I am pleased  to say that, unlike  42 percent  of peoplt,  I have    read the book  at number  one, George  Orwell’s  1984.  I think  it’s really  brilliant.  The World  Book  Day report  also has some  other  interesting  information  in it. It says that many  people  lie about  having  read jane Austen,  Charles  Dickens,  Fyodor  Dostoevsky  (I haven’t  read him, but haven’t  lied about  it either)and  Herman  Melville.  Asked  why they lied, the most  common  reason  was to “impress”  someone  they were  speaking  to. This coule  be tricky  if the conversation  became  more  in – depth!  But when  asked  which  authors  they actually  enjoy,  people  named  J.k. Rowling,  John  Grisham,  Sophie  Kinsella  (ah, the big sellers,  in other  words).  Forty-two  percent  of people  asked  admitted  they turned  to the back  of the book  to read the end before  finishing  the story  (I’ll come  clean:  I do this and am astonished  that 58 percent  said they had never  dome  so). 64.

B. 42% of people  pretended  to have  read 1984.  C. The author  admitted  having  read 9 books.       D. Dreams  From  My Father  is hardly  read.  66. By lying  about  reading,  a person  hopes  to      . A. control  the conversation         B. appear  knowledgeable  C. learn  about  the book            D. make  more  friends  67.

Written  accounts  from  the 18th and 19th centuries  described  flocks（群） so large  that they darkened  the sky for hours.  It was calculated  that when  its population  reach  its highest  point,  there  were  more  than 3 billion  passenger  pigeons  – a number  equal  to 24 to 40 percent  of the total bird population  in the United  States,  making  it perhaps  the most  abundant  birds  in the world.  Even  as late as 1870  when  their numbers  had already  become  smaller,  a flock  believed  to be 1 mile wide  and 320 miles  (about  515 kilometers)  long was seen near Cincinnati.  Sadly,  the abundance  of passenger  pigeons  may have  been  their undoing . Where  the birds  were  abundant,  people  believed  there  was an ever-lasting  supply  and killed  them  by the thousands.  Commercial  hunters  attracted  them  to small  clearings  with grain,  waited  until pigeons  had settled  to feed,  then threw  large  nets over them,  taking  hundreds  at a time.  The birds  were  shipped  to large  cities  and sold in restaurants.  By the closing  decades  of the 19th century,  the hardwood  forests  where  passenger  pigeons  nested  had been  damaged  by Americans’  need  for wood,  which  scattered（驱散） the flocks  and forced  the birds  to go farther  north,  where  cold temperatures  and spring  storms  contributed  to their decline.  Soon  the great  flocks  were  gone,  never  to be seen again.  In 1897,  the state of Michigan  passed  a law prohibiting  the killing  of passenger  pigeons,  but by then,  no sizable  flocks  had been  seen in the state for 10 years.  The last confirmed  wild pigeon  in the United  States  was shot by a boy in Pike County,  Ohio,  in 1900.  For a time,  a few birds  survived  under  human  care.  The last of them,  known  affectionately  as Martha,  died at the Cincinnati  Zoological  Garden  in September  1, 1914.    24. In the 18th and early  19th centuries , passenger  pigeons　   　. A. were  the biggest  bird in the world  B. lived  mainly  in the south  of America  C. did great  harm  to the natural  environment  D. were  the largest  bird population  in the US 25.

The whip  gets all of the attention , but it’s mostly  for show . In reality , it’s the chair  that does the important  work . When  a lion tamer  holds  a chair  in front  of the lion’s face, the lion tries to focus  on all four legs of the chair  at the same  time. With  its focus  divided , the lion becomes  confused  and is unsure  about  what  to do next. When  faced  with so many  options , the lion chooses  to freeze  and wait instead  of attacking  the man holding  the chair .     How  often  do you find yourself  in the same  position  as the lion? How  often  do you have  something  you want  to achieve（e.g. lose weight , start a business , travel  more）--- only to end up confused  by all of the options  in front  of you and never  make  progress ?     This upsets  me to no end because  while  all the experts  are busy  debating  about  which  option  is best, the people  who want  to improve  their lives  are left confused  by all of the conflicting  information . The end result  is that we feel like we can’t focus  or that we’re focused  on the wrong  things , and so we take less action , make  less progress ,   and stay the same  when  we could  be improving .     It doesn ’t have  to be that way. Anytime  you find the world  waving  a chair  in your face, remember  this: All you need  to do is focus  on one thing . You just need  to get started . Starting  before  you feel ready  is one of the habits  of successful  people . If you have  somewhere  you want  to go, something  you want  to accomplish , someone  you want  to become  … take immediate  action .

In fact, half of the 6,000-7,000  languages  spoken  around  the world  today  will likely  die out by the next century,  according  to the United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific,  and Cultural  Organization  (UNESCO).   In an effort  to prevent  language  loss, scholars  from  a number  of organizations- -- UNESCO  and National  Geographic  among  them ---have  for many  years  been  documenting  dying  languages  and the cultures  they reflect.  Mark  Turin,  a scientist  at the Macmillan  Center,  Yale  University,  who specializes  in the languages  and oral traditions  of the Himalayas,  is following  in that   tradition . His recently  published  book,  A Grammar  of Thangmi  with an Ethnolinguistic  Introduction  to the Speakers  and Their  Culture , grows  out of his experience  living,  looking  and raising  a family  in a village  in Nepal.  Documenting  the Tangmi  language  and culture  is just a starting  point  for Turin,  who seeks  to include  other  languages  and oral traditions  across  the Himalayans  reaches  of India,  Nepal,  Bhutan,  and China.  But he is not content  to simply  record  these  voices  before  they disappear  without  record.  At the University  of Cambridge  Turin  discovered  a wealth  of important  materials ---including  photographs,  films,  tap recordings,  and field notes- --which  had remained  unstudied  and were  badly  in need  of care and protection.  Now,  through  the two organizations  that he has founded- --the Digital  Himalaya  Project  and the World  Oral Literature  Project- --Turin  has started  a campaign  to make  such documents,  found  in libraries  and stores  around  the world,  available  not just to scholars  but to the youngers.  Generations  of communities  from  whom  the materials  were  originally  collected.  Thanks  to digital  technology  and the widely  available  Internet.  Turin  notes,  the endangered  languages  can be saved  and reconnected  with speech  communities.  32. Many  scholars  are making  efforts  to　   　.

Au Pair in Stamford,  for example,  has got increasing  numbers  of request  for Chinese  au pairs  from  aero to around  4,000  since  2004.  And that’s  true all across  the country.  “I thought  it would  be useful  for him to learn  Chinese  at an early  age” Joseph  Stocke,  the managing  director  of s company,  says of his 2-year -old son. “I would  at least like to give him the chance  to use the language  in the future .” After  only six months  of being  cared  by 25-year-old  woman  from  China,  the boy can already  understand  basic  Chinese  daily  expressions,  his dad says.  Li Drake,  a Chinese  native  raising  two children  in Minnesota  with an American  husband,  had another  reason  for looking  for an au pair from  China.  She didn’t  want  her children  to miss out on their roots.  “Because  I am Chinese,  my husband  and I   wanted  the children  to keep  exposed  to (接触 ) the language  and culture.”  she says.  “Staying  with a native  speaker  is better  for children  than simply  sitting  in a classroom,”  says Suzanne  Flynn,  a professor  in language  education  of Children.  “But parents  must  understand  that just one year with au pair is unlikely  to produce  wonders.   Complete  mastery  demands  continued  learning  until the age of 10 or 12.” The popularity  if au pairs  from  China  has been  strengthened  by the increasing  numbers  of American  parents  who want  their children  who want  their children  to learn  Chinese.  It is expected  that American  demand  for au pairs  will continue  to rise in the next few years.  29. What  does that term “au pair” in the text mean ? 　   　 A. A mother  raising  her children  on her own. B. A child  learning  a foreign  language  at home . C. A professor  in language  education  of children . D. A young  foreign  woman  taking  care of children . 30. Li Drake  has her children  study  Chinese  because  she wants  them　   　. A. to live in China  some  day        B. to speak  the language  at home  C. to catch  up wit other  children      D. to learn  about  the Chinese  culture  31.

I left for the land of warmth  and vitamin  C (维生素C), thinking  of beaches  and orange  trees.  When  we touched  down  to blue skies  and warm  air, I sent up a small  prayer  of gratefulness.  Swimming  pools,  wine  tasting,  and pink sunsets  (at normal  evening  hours,  not 4 in the afternoon)  filled  the weekend,  but the best part — particularly  to my taste,  dulled  by months  of cold — weather  root vegetables  — was a 7 a.m. adventure  to the Sarasota  farmers’  market  that proved  to be more  than worth  the early  wake-up  call. The market,  which  was founded  in 1979,  sets up its tents  every  Saturday  from  7 a.m. to 1 p.m.,  rain or shine,  along  North  Lemon  and State  streets.  Baskets  of perfect    red strawberries,  the red-painted  sides  of the Java Dawg  coffee  truck;  and most  of all, the tomatoes:  amazing,  large,  soft and round  red tomatoes.  Disappointed  by many  a broken,  vine-ripened  (蔓上成熟的 ) promise,  I’ve refused  to buy winter  tomatoes  for years.  No matter  how attractive  they look in the store,  once  I get them  home  they’re  unfailingly  dry, hard,  and tasteless.  But I homed  in, with uncertainty,  on one particular  table  at the Brown’s  Grove  Farm’s  stand,  full of fresh  and soft tomatoes  the size of my fist. These  were  the real deal — and at that moment,  I realized  that the best part of Sarasota  in winter  was going  to be eating  things  that back  home  in New  York  I wouldn’t  be experiencing  again  for months.  Delighted  as I was by the tomatoes  in sight,  my happiness  deepened  when  I learned  that Brown’s  Grove  Farm  is one of the suppliers  for Jack Dusty,  a newly  opened  restaurant  at the Sarasota  Ritz Carlton,  where  — luckily  for me — I was planning  to have  dinner  that very night.  Without  even  seeing  the menu,  I knew  I’d be ordering  every  tomato  on it. 24. What  did the author  think  of her winter  life in New  York?  A. Exciting.     B. Boring.       C. Relaxing.       D. Annoying.  25. What  made  the author’s  getting  up early  worthwhile?  A. Having  a swim.   B. Breathing  in fresh  air.  C. Walking  in the morning  sun. D. Visiting  a local  farmer’s  market.  26. What  can we learn  about  tomatoes  sold in New  York  in winter?  A. They  are soft.  B. They  look nice.   C. They  taste great.  D. They  are juicy.  27.

The exhibition  shows  how Dali draws  the viewer  between  two infinities  (无限 ), “From  the infinity  small  to the infinity  large,  contraction  and expansion  coming  in and out of focus:  amazing  Flemish  accuracy  and the showy  Baroque  of old painting  that he used in his museum-theatre  in Figueras, ” explains  the Pompidou  Centre.  The fine selection  of the major  works  was done  in close  collaboration  (合作 ) with the Museo  Nacional  Reina  Sofia  in Madrid,  Spain,  and with contributions  from  other  institutions  like the Salvador  Dali Museum  in St. Petersburg,  Florida.  28.

This evening,  as on every    Thursday  night,  psychologist  Maud  Lehanne  is leading  two of France’s  favorite  pastimes,  coffee  drinking  and the “talking  cure”. Here  they are learning  to get in touch  with their true feelings.  It isn’t always  easy.  The customers  — some  thirty  Parisians  who pay just under  $2 (plus  drinks)  per session  — care quick  to intellectualize  (高谈阔论 ), slow  to open  up and connect.  “You are forbidden  to say ‘one feels’  or ‘people  think’ ” Lehanne  told them.  “Say ‘I think,’  ‘Think  me’.”  A café society  where  no intellectualizing  is allowed?  It couldn’t  seem  more  un-French.  But Lehanne’s  psychology  café is about  more  than knowing  oneself:  It’s trying  to help the city’s  troubled  neighborhood  cafes.  Over  the years,  Parisian  cafes  have  fallen  victim  to changes  in the French  lifestyle  — longer  working  hours,  a fast food boom  and a younger  generation’s  desire  to spend  more  time at home.  Dozens  of new theme  cafes  appear  to change  the situation.  Cafes  focused  around  psychology,  history,  and engineering  are catching  on, filling  tables  well into the evening.  The city’s  “psychology  cafes ”, which  offer  great  comfort,  are among  the most  popular  places.  Middle-aged  homemakers,  retirees,  and the unemployed  come  to such cafes  to talk about  love,  anger,  and dreams  with a psychologist.  And they come  to Lehanne’s  group  just to learn  to say what  they feel. “There’s  a strong  need  in Paris  for communication, ” says Maurice  Frisch,  a café La Chope  regular  who works  as a religious  instructor  in a nearby  church.  “People  have  few real friends.  And they need  to open  up”. Lehanne  says she’d  like to see psychology  cafes  all over France.  “If people  had normal  lives,  these  cafes  wouldn’t  exist, ” she says.  “If life weren’t  a battle,  people  wouldn’t  need  a special  place  just to speak. ” But then,  it wouldn’t  be France.    32. What  are people  encouraged  to do at the cafe La Chope?   A. Learn  a new subject.    B. Keep  in touch  with friends.   C. Show  off their knowledge.   D. Express  their true feelings.   33. How  are cafes  affected  by French  lifestyle  changes?   A. They  are less frequently  visited.   B. They  stay open  for longer  hours.   C. They  have  bigger  night  crowds.   D. They  start to serve  fast food.   34. What  are theme  cafes  expected  to do?  A. Create  more  jobs.    B. Supply  better  drinks.     C. Save  the cafe business.   D.

I was able to buy it a little over a year ago because  I had my relatives  give me money  for my birthday  instead  of a lot of clothes  that wouldn’t  fit. I let a salesclerk  fool me into buying  a discontinued  model.  I realized  this a day late, when  I saw newspaper  advertisements  for the set at seventy-five  dollars  less than I had paid.  The set worked  so beautifully  when  I first got it home  that I would  keep  it on until stations  signed  off for the night.  Fortunately,  I didn’t  got any channels  showing  all-night  movies  or I would  never  have  gotten  to bed. Then  I started  developing  a problem  with the set that involved  static  (静电 ) noise.  For some  reason,  when  certain  shows  switched  into a commercial,  a loud noise  would  sound  for a few seconds.  Gradually,  this noise  began  to appear  during  a show,  and to get rid of it, I had to change  to another  channel  and then change  it back.  Sometimes  this technique  would  not work,  and I had to pick up the set and shake  it to remove  the sound.  I actually  began  to build  up my arm muscles  (肌肉 ) shaking  my set. When  neither  of these  methods  removed  the static  noise,  I would  sit helplessly  and wait for the noise  to go away.  At last I ended  up hitting  the set with my fist, and it stopped  working  altogether.  My trip to the repair  shop  cost me $62, and the set is working  well now,  but I keep  expecting  more  trouble.  21. Why  did the author  say he was fooled  into buying  the TV set? A. He got an older  model  than he had expected.  B. He couldn’t  return  it when  it was broken.  C. He could  have  bought  it at a lower  price.    D. He failed  to find any movie  shows  on it. 22.

Experts  say the way you design  your home  could  play a role in whether  you pack  on the pounds  or keep  them  off. You can make  your environment  work  for you instead  of against  you. Here  are some  ways  to turn your home  into part of diet plan.  Open  the curtains  and turn up the lights.  Dark  environments  are more  likely  to encourage  overeating,  for people  are often  less self-conscious （难为情） when  they’re  in poorly  lit places-and  so more  likely  to eat lots of food.  If your home  doesn’t  have  enough  window  light,  get more  lamps  and flood  the place  with brightness.  Mind  the colors.  Research  suggests  warm  colors  fuel our appetites.  In one study,  people  who ate meals  in a blue room  consumed  33 percent  less than those  in a yellow  or red room.  Warm  colors  like yellow  make  food appear  more  appetizing,  while  cold colors  make  us feel less hungry.  So when  it’s time to repaint,  go blue.  Don’t  forget  the clock—or the radio.  People  who eat slowly  tend to consume  about  70 fewer  calories（卡路里） per meal  than those  who rush through  their meals.  Begin  keeping  track  of the time,  and try to make  dinner  last at least 30 minutes,  And while  you’re  at it, actually  sit down  to eat. If you need  some  help slowing  down,  turn on relaxing  music.  It makes  you less likely  to rush through  a meal.  Downsize  the dishes,  Big serving  bowls  and plates  can easily  make  us fat. We eat about  22 percent  more  when  using  a 12-inch  plate  instead  of a 10-inch  plate.    When  we choose  a large  spoon  over a smaller  one ,total  intake（摄入）  jumps  by 14 percent.  And we’ll  pour about  30 percent  more  liquid  into a short,  wide  glass  than a tall, skinny  glass.  25. The text is especially  helpful  for those  who care about_______.

It used to be called  the “year  off” between  school  and university.  The gap-year  phenomenon  originated  (起源 ) with the months  left over to Oxbridge  applicants  between  entrance  exams  in November  and the start of the next academic  year.  This year,  25,310  students  who have  accepted  places  in higher  education  institutions  have  put off their entry  until next year,  according  to statistics  on university  entrance  provided  by University  and College  Admissions  Service  (UCAS).  That is a record  14.7%  increase  in the number  of students  taking  a gap year.  Tony  Higgins  from  UCAS  said that the statistics  are good  news  for everyone  in higher  education.  “Students  who take a well-planned  year out are more  likely  to be satisfied  with,  and complete,  their chosen  course.  Students  who take a gap year are often  more  mature  and responsible,”  he said.   But not everyone  is happy.  Owain  James,  the president  of the National  Union  of Students  (NUS),  argued  that the increase  is evidence  of student  had ship — young  people  are being  forced  into earning  money  before  finishing  their education.  “New  students  are now aware  that they are likely  to leave  university  up to ￡15,000  in debt.  It is not surprising  that more  and more  students  are taking  a gap year to earn money  to support  their study  for the degree.  NUS  statistics  show  that over 40% of students  are  forced  to work  during  term time and the figure  increases  to 90% during  vacation  periods,”  he said. 29. What  do we learn  about  the gap year from  the text?  A. It is flexible  in length.        B. It is a time for relaxation.  C. It is increasingly  popular.     D. It is required  by universities.  30. According  to Tony  Higgins,  students  taking  a gap year______.  A. are better  prepared  for college  studies  B. know  a lot more  about  their future  jobs C. are more  likely  to leave  university  in debt D. have  a better  chance  to enter  top universities  31. How  does Owain  James  feel about  the gap-year  phenomenon?  A. He’s puzzled.   B. He’s worried.   C. He’s surprised.   D. He’s annoyed.  32. What  would  most  students  do on their vacation  according  to NUS  statistics?  A. Attend  additional  courses.         B. Make  plans  for the new term.  C. Earn  money  for their education.

Of the outstanding  ladies  listed  below,  who do you think  was the most  important  woman  of the past 100 years?   Jane  Addams  (1860-1935)  Anyone  who has ever been  helped  by a social  worker  has Jane Addams  to thank.  Addams  helped  the poor and worked  for peace.  She encouraged  a sense  of community  (社区 ) by creating  shelters  and promoting  education  and services  for people  in need.  In 1931,  Addams  became  the first American  woman  to win the Nobel  Peace  Prize.   Rachel  Carson  (1907-1964)  If it weren’t  for Rachel  Carson,  the environmental  movement  might  not exist  today.  Her popular  1962  book  Silent  Spring  raised  awareness  of the dangers  of pollution  and the harmful  effects  of chemicals  on humans  and on the world’s  lakes  and oceans.   Sandra  Day O’Connor  (1930-present)  When  Sandra  Day O’Connor  finished  third  in her class  at Stanford  Law School,  in 1952,  she could  not find work  at a law firm because  she was a woman.  She became  an Arizona  state senator  (参议员 ) and, in 1981,  the first woman  to join the U.S. Supreme  Court.  O’Connor  gave  the deciding  vote in many  important  cases  during  her 24 years  on the top court.     Rosa  Parks  (1913-2005)  On December  1, 1955,  in Montgomery,  Alabama,  Rasa  Parks  would  not give up her seat on a bus to a passenger.  Her simple  act landed  Parks  in prison.  But it also set off the Montgomery  bus boycott.  It lasted  for more  than a year,  and kicked  off the civil-rights  movement.  “The  only tired I was, was tired of giving  in,” said Parks.  21. What  is Jane Addams  noted  for in history?  A. Her social  work.            B. Her teaching  skills.  C. Her efforts  to win a prize.     D. Her community  background.  22. What  was the reason  for O’Connor’s  being  rejected  by the law firm?  A. Her lack of proper  training  in law. B. Her little work  experience  in court.  C. The discrimination  against  women.  D. The poor financial  conditions.  23. Who  made  a great  contribution  to the civil-rights  movement  in the U.S.?  A. Jane Addams.      B. Rachel  Carson.  C. Sandra  Day O’Connor.      D. Ross  Parks.  24. What  can we infer  about  the women  mentioned  in the text?  A. They  are highly  educated.      B. They  are truly  creative.  C. They  are pioneers.         D.

Even  when  her daughter  and son asked  her to move  to San Antonio  to help with their children,  she politely  refused.  Only  after a year of friendly  discussion  did Ms. Garza  finally  say yes. That was four years  ago. Today  all three  generations  regard  the move  as a success,  giving  them  a closer  relationship  than they would  have  had in separate  cities.  No statistics  show  the number  of grandparents  like Garza  who are moving  closer  to adult  children  and grandchildren.  Yet there  is evidence  suggesting  that the trend  is   growing.  Even  President  Obama’s  mother-in-law,  Marian  Robinson,  has agreed  to leave  Chicago  and move  into the White  House  to help care for her granddaughters.  According  to a study  by grandparents.com,  83 percent  of the people  said Mrs. Robinson’s  decision  will influence  grandparents  in the American  family.  Two-thirds  believe  more  families  will follow  the example  of Obama’s  family.  “In the 1960s  we were  all a little wild and couldn’t  get away  from  home  far enough  or fast enough  to prove  we could  do it on our own,”  says Christine  Crosby,  publisher  of Grand , a magazine  for grandparents.  “We now realize  how important  family  is and how important  it is to be near them,  especially  when  you’re  raising  children.”  Moving  is not for everyone.  Almost  every  grandparent  wants  to be with his or her grandchildren  and is willing  to make  sacrifices,  but sometimes  it is wiser  to say no and visit frequently  instead.  Having  your grandchildren  far away  is hard,  especially  knowing  your adult  child  is struggling,  but giving  up the life you know  may be harder.  25. Why  was Garza’s  move  a success?  A. It strengthened  her family  ties. B. It improved  her living  conditions.  C. It enabled  her make  more  friends.  D. It helped  her know  more  new places.  26. What  was the reaction  of the public  to Mrs. Robinson’s  decision?  A. 17% expressed  their support  for it. B. Few people  responded  sympathetically.  C. 83% believed  it had a bad influence.  D. The majority  thought  it was a trend.  27. What  did Crosby  say about  people  in the 1960s?  A. They  were  unsure  of themselves.  B. They  were  eager  to raise  more  children.  C. They  wanted  to live away  from  their parents.  D. They  had little respect  for their grandparents.    28. What  does the author  suggest  the grandparents  do in the last paragraph?  A.

Silences  may be thoughtful,  or they may be empty  when  a person  has nothing  to say. A silence  in a conversation  may also show  stubbornness,  uneasiness,  or worry.  Silence  may be viewed  by some  cultural  groups  as extremely  uncomfortable;  therefore  attempts  may be made  to fill every  gap (间隙 ) with conversation.  Persons  in other  cultural  groups  value  silence  and view  it as necessary  for understanding  a person’s  needs.   Many  Native  Americans  value  silence  and feel it is a basic  part of communicating  among  people,  just as some  traditional  Chinese  and Thai persons  do. Therefore,  when  a person  from  one of these  cultures  is speaking  and suddenly  stops,  what  maybe  implied  (暗示 ) is that the person  wants  the listener  to consider  what  has been  said before  continuing.  In these  cultures,  silence  is a call for reflection.  Other  cultures  may use silence  in other  ways,  particularly  when  dealing  with conflicts  among  people  or in relationships  of people  with different  amounts  of power.  For example,  Russian,  French,  and Spanish  persons  may use silence  to show  agreement  between  parties  about  the topic  under  discussion.  However,  Mexicans  may use silence  when  instructions  are given  by a person  in authority  rather  than be rude to that person  by arguing  with him or her. In still another  use, persons  in Asian  cultures  may view  silence  as a sign of respect,  particularly  to an elder  or a person  in authority.  Nurses  and other  care-givers  need  to be aware  of the possible  meanings  of silence  when  they come  across  the personal  anxiety  their patients  may be experiencing.  Nurses  should  recognize  their own personal  and cultural  construction  of silence  so that a patient’s  silence  is not interrupted  too early  or allowed  to go on unnecessarily.  A nurse  who understands  the healing  (治愈 ) value  of silence  can use this understanding  to assist  in the care of patients  from  their own and from  other    cultures.  32. What  does the author  say about  silence  in conversations?  A. It implies  anger.              B. It promotes  friendship.  C. It is culture-specific.           D. It is content-based.  33. Which  of the following  people  might  regard  silence  as a call for careful  thought?  A. The Chinese.     B. The French.     C. The Mexicans.    D. The Russians.  34. What  does the author  advise  nurses  to do about  silence?  A. Let it continue  as the patient  pleases.     B. Break  it while  treating  patients.  C. Evaluate  its harm  to patients.         D. Make  use of its healing  effects.  35. What  may be the best title for the text?  A. Sound  and Silence               B. What  It Means  to Be Silent  C. Silence  to Native  Americans       D.

I put a small  set of Tinkertoys  in front  of each student,  and said:  “Make  something  out of the Tinkertoys.  You have  45 minutes  today  ― and 45 minutes  each day for the rest of the week.”  A few students  hesitated  to start.  They  waited  to see what  the rest of the class  would  do. Several  others  checked  the instructions  and made  something  according  to one of the model  plans  provided.  Another  group  built something  out of their own imaginations.    Once  I had a boy who worked  experimentally  with Tinkertoys  in his free time.  His constructions  filled  a shelf  in the art classroom  and a good  part of his bedroom  at home.  I was delighted  at the presence  of such a student.  Here  was an exceptionally  creative  mind  at work.  His presence  meant  that I had an unexpected  teaching  assistant  in class  whose  creativity  would  infect  (感染 ) other  students.  Encouraging  this kind of thinking  has a downside . I ran the risk of losing  those  students  who had a different  style  of thinking.  Without  fail one would  declare,  “But  I’m just not creative.”  “Do you dream  at night  when  you’re  asleep?”  “Oh,  sure.”  “So tell me one of your most  interesting  dreams.”  The student  would  tell something  wildly  imaginative.  Flying  in the sky or in a time machine  or growing  three  heads.  “That’s  pretty  creative.  Who  does that for you?”  “Nobody.  I do it.” “Really  ― at night,  when  you’re  asleep?”  “Sure.”  “Try  doing  it in the daytime,  in class,  okay?”  25. The teacher  used Tinkertoys  in class  in order  to ________?  A. know  more  about  the students     B. make  the lessons  more  exciting  C. raise  the students’  interest  in art   D. teach  the students  about  toy design  26. What  do we know  about  the boy mentioned  in Paragraph  3? A. He liked  to help his teacher.      B. He preferred  to study  alone.  C. He was active  in class.           D. He was imaginative.  27. What  does the underlined  word  “downside”  in Paragraph  4 probably  mean?  A. Mistake.     B. Drawback.       C. Difficulty.      D. Burden.  28.

Think  of the people  who belong  to book  groups.  They  choose  books  to read and then meet  to discuss  them.  Now,  the website  BookCrossing.com  turns  the page  on the traditional  idea of a book  group.  Members  go on the site and register  the books  they own and would  like to share.  BookCrossing  provides  an identification  number  to stick  inside  the book.  Then  the person  leaves  it in a public  place,  hoping  that the book  will have  an adventure,  traveling  far and wide  with each new reader  who finds  it. Bruce  Pederson,  the managing  director  of BookCrossing,  says,  “The  two things  that change  your life are the people  you meet  and books  you read.  BookCrossing  combines  both.”  Members  leave  books  on park benches  and buses,  in train stations  and coffee  shops.  Whoever  finds  their book  will go to the site and record  where  they found  it. People  who find a book  can also leave  a journal  entry  describing  what  they thought  of it. E-mails  are then sent to the BookCrossing  to keep  them  updated  about  where  their books  have  been  found.  Bruce  Peterson  says the idea is for people  not to be selfish  by keeping  a book  to gather  dust on a shelf  at home.  BookCrossing  is part of a trend  among  people  who want  to get back  to the “real”  and not the virtual  (虚拟 ). The site now has more  than one million  members  in more  than one hundred  thirty-five  countries.  29. Why  does the author  mention  book  groups  in the first paragraph?  A. To explain  what  they are.          B. To introduce  BookCrossing.  C. To stress  the importance  of reading.   D. To encourage  readers  to share  their ideas.  30. What  does the underlined  word  “it” in Paragraph  2 refer  to? A. The book.            B. An adventure.  C. A public  place.        D. The identification  number.  31. What  will a BookCrosser  do with a book  after reading  it? A. Meet  other  readers  to discuss  it.      B. Keep  it safe in his bookcase.  C. Pass it on to another  reader.          D.

Frank  Hurley’s  pictures  would  be outstanding  ― undoubtedly  first-rate  photo-journalism  ― if they had been  made  last week.  In fact, they were  shot from  1914  through  1916,  most  of them  after a disastrous  shipwreck  (海 难 ), by a cameraman  who had no reasonable  expectation  of survival.  Many  of the images  were  stored  in an ice chest,  under  freezing  water,  in the damaged  wooden  ship.  The ship was the Endurance , a small,  tight,  Norwegian-built  three-master  that was intended  to take Sir Ernest  Shackleton  and a small  crew  of seamen  and scientists,  27 men in all, to the southernmost  shore  of Antarctica’s  Weddell  Sea. From  that point  Shackleton  wanted  to force  a passage  by dog sled (雪橇 ) across  the continent.  The journey  was intended  to achieve  more  than what  Captain  Robert  Falcon  Scott  had done.  Captain  Scott  had reached  the South  Pole early  in 1912  but had died with his four companions  on the march  back.  As writer  Caroline  Alexander  makes  clear  in her forceful  and well-researched  story  The Endurance , adventuring  was even  then a thoroughly  commercial  effort.  Scott’s  last journey,  completed  as he lay in a tent dying  of cold and hunger,  caught  the world’s  imagination,  and a film made  in his honor  drew  crowds.  Shackleton,  a onetime  British  merchant-navy  officer  who had got to within  100 miles  of the South  Pole in 1908,  started  a business  before  his 1914  voyage  to make  money  from  movie  and still photography.  Frank  Hurley,  a confident  and gifted  Australian  photographer  who knew  the Antarctic,  was hired  to make  the images,  most  of which  have  never  before  been  published.  33. What  do we know  about  the photos  taken  by Hurley?    A. They  were  made  last week.         B. They  showed  undersea  sceneries.  C. They  were  found  by a cameraman.   D. They  recorded  a disastrous  adventure.  34. Who  reached  the South  Pole first according  to the text?  A. Frank  Hurley.             B. Ernest  Shackleton.  C. Robert  Falcon  Scott.        D. Caroline  Alexander.  35. What  does Alexander  think  was the purpose  of the 1914  voyage?  A. Artistic  creation.        B. Scientific  research.  C. Money  making.         D.

They settled in at a comfortable East Side cafe and within minutes, another customer was approaching their table.“Hey, aren’t you from Mississippi?” the elegant, white-haired writer remembered being asked by the stranger. “I’m from Mississippi too.”   Without a second thought, the woman joined the Welty party. When her dinner partner showed up, she also pulled up a chair.“They began telling me all the news of Mississippi,” Welty said. “I didn’t know what my New York friends were thinking.”    Taxis on a rainy New York night are rarer than sunshine. By the time the group got up to leave, it was pouring outside. Welty’s new friends immediately sent a waiter to find a cab. Heading back downtown toward her hotel, her big-city friends were amazed at the turn of events that had changed their Big Apple dinner into a Mississippi state reunion (团聚).“My friends said: ‘Now we believe your stories,’” Welty added. “And I said: ‘Now you know. These are the people that make me write them.’”Sitting on a sofa in her room, Welty, a slim figure in a simple gray dress, looked pleased with this explanation.“I don’t make them up,” she said of the characters in her fiction these last 50 or so years. “I don’t have to.”Beauticians, bartenders, piano players and people with purple hats, Welty’s people come from afternoons spent visiting with old friends, from walks through the streets of her native Jackson, Miss., from conversations overheard on a bus.

It’s called Apple Day but in practice it’s more like Apple Month. The day itself is on October 21, but since it has caught on, events now spread out over most of October around Britain.Visiting an apple event is a good chance to see, and often taste, a wide variety of apples. To people who are used to the limited choice of apples such as Golden Delicious and Royal Gala in supermarkets, it can be quite an eye opener to see the range of classical apples still in existence, such as Decio which was grown by the Romans. Although it doesn’t taste of anything special, it’s still worth a try, as is the knobbly (多疙瘩的) Cat’s Head which is more of a curiosity than anything else.There are also varieties developed to suit specific local conditions. One of the very best varieties for eating quality is Orleans Reinette, but you’ll need a warm, sheltered place with perfect soil to grow it, so it’s a pipe dream for most apple lovers who fall for it.At the events, you can meet expert growers and discuss which ones will best suit your conditions, and because these are family affairs, children are well catered for with apple-themed fun and games.Apple Days are being held at all sorts of places with an interest in fruit, including stately gardens and commercial orchards (果园). If you want to have a real orchard experience, try visiting the National Fruit Collection at Brogdale, near Faversham in Kent.28. What can people do at the apple events?A.

If it bleeds, it leads. No news is good news, and good news is no news. Those are the classic rules for the evening broadcasts and the morning papers. But now that information is being spread and monitored (监控) in different ways, researchers are discovering new rules. By tracking people’s e-mails and online posts, scientists have found that good news can spread faster and farther than disasters and sob stories.   “The ‘if it bleeds’ rule works for mass media,” says Jonah Berger, a scholar at the University of Pennsylvania. “They want your eyeballs and don’t care how you’re feeling. But when you share a story with your friends, you care a lot more how they react. You don’t want them to think of you as a Debbie Downer.”   Researchers analyzing word-of-mouth communication — e-mails, Web posts and reviews, face-to-face conversations — found that it tended to be more positive than negative (消极的), but that didn’t necessarily mean people preferred positive news. Was positive news shared more often simply because people experienced more good things than bad things? To test for that possibility, Dr. Berger looked at how people spread a particular set of news stories: thousands of articles on The New York Times’ website. He and a Penn colleague analyzed the “most e-mailed” list for six months. One of his first findings was that articles in the science section were much more likely to make the list than non-science articles. He found that science amazed Times’ readers and made them want to share this positive feeling with others.Readers also tended to share articles that were exciting or funny, or that inspired negative feelings like anger or anxiety, but not articles that left them merely sad. They needed to be aroused (激发) one way or the other, and they preferred good news to bad. The more positive an article, the more likely it was to be shared, as Dr. Berger explains in his new book, “Contagious: Why Things Catch On.” 32.

Trying  to help injured,  displaced  or sick creatures  can be heartbreaking;  survival  is never  certain.  However,  when  it works,  it is simply  beautiful.   I got a rescue  call from  a woman  in Muttontown.  She had found  a young  owl (猫头鹰 ) on the ground.  When  I arrived,  I saw a 2-to 3-week-old  owl. It had already  been  placed  in a carrier  for safety.   I examined  the chick  (雏鸟 ) and it seemed  fine. If I could  locate  the nest, I might  have  been  able to put it back,  but no luck.  My next work  was to construct  a nest and anchor  it in a tree.  The homeowner  was very helpful.  A wire basket  was found.  I put some  pine branches  into the basket  to make  this nest safe and comfortable.  I placed  the chick  in the nest, and it quickly  calmed  down.   Now  all that was needed  were  the parents,  but they were  absent.  I gave  the homeowner  a recording  of the hunger  screams  of owl chicks.  These  advertise  the presence  of chicks  to adults;  they might  also encourage  our chick  to start calling  as well.  I gave  the owner  as much  information  as possible  and headed  home  to see what  news  the night  might  bring.   A nervous  night  to be sure,  but sometimes  the spirits  of nature  smile  on us all!   The homeowner  called  to say that the parents  had responded  to the recordings.  I drove  over and saw the chick  in the nest looking  healthy  and active.  And it was accompanied  in the nest by the greatest  sight  of all — LUNCH!

UNESCO(  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and Cultural  Organization)  recently  set April  30 as a day to raise  awareness  of jazz music,  its significance,  and its potential  as a unifying  (联合 ) voice  across  cultures.  Despite  the celebrations,  though,  in the U.S. the jazz audience  continues  to shrink  and grow  older,  and the music  has failed  to connect  with younger  generations.  It’s Jason  Moran’s  job to help change  that. As the Kennedy  Center’s  artistic  adviser  for jazz, Moran  hopes  to widen  the audience  for jazz, make  the music  more  accessible,  and preserve  its history  and culture.  “Jazz  seems  like it’s not really  a part of the American  appetite,”  Moran  tells National  Public  Radio’s  reporter  Neal  Conan.  “What  I’m hoping  to accomplish  is that my generation  and younger  start to reconsider  and understand  that jazz is not black  and write  anymore.  It’s actually  color,  and it’s actually  digital.”    Moran  says one of the problems  with jazz today  is that the entertainment  aspect  of the music  has been  lost. “The  music  can’t  be presented  today  the way it was in 1908  or 1958.  It has to continue  to move,  because  the way the world  works  is not the same,”  says Moran.  Last year,  Moran  worked  on a project  that arranged  Fats Waller’s  music  for a dance  party,  “Just  to kind of put it back  in the mind  that Waller  is dance  music  as much  as it is concert  music,”  says Moran.  “For me, it’s the recontextualization.  In music,  where  does the emotion  (情感 ) lie? Are we, as humans,  gaining  any insight  (感悟 ) on how to talk about  ourselves  and how something  as abstract  as a Charlie  Parker  record  gets us into a dialogue  about  our emotions  and our thoughts?  Sometimes  we lose sight  that the music  has a wider  context,”  says Moran,  “so I want  to continue  those  dialogues.  Those  are the things  I want  to foster.”  28. Why  did UNESCO  set April  30 as International  Jazz Day?  A. To remember  the birth  of jazz. B. To protect  cultural  diversity.  C. To encourage  people  to study  music.  D. To recognize  the value  of jazz. 29. What  does the underlined  word  “that”  in paragraph  3 refer  to? A. Jazz becoming  more  accessible.  B. The production  of jazz growing  faster.  C. Jazz being  less popular  with the young.  D. The jazz audience  becoming  larger.   30. What  can we infer  about  Moran’s  opinion  on jazz?  A. It will disappear  gradually.          B. It remains  black  and white.  C. It should  keep  up with the times.     D. It changes  every  50 years.  31. Which  of the following  can be the best title for the text?  A. Exploring  the Future  of Jazz.     B. The Rise and Fall of Jazz.  C. The Story  of a Jazz Musician.     D.

Developed  by two doctors  in the U.S. Department  of Agriculture,  it’s an excellent  water  collector.  Unfortunately,  you must  carry  the necessary  equipment  with you, since  it’s all but impossible  to find natural  substitutes.  The only components  required,  though,  are a 5'×5'  sheet  of clear  or slightly  milky  plastic,  six feet of plastic  tube,  and a container  — perhaps  just a drinking  cup — to catch  the water.  These  pieces  can be folded  into a neat little pack  and fastened  on your belt.     To construct  a working  still, use a sharp  stick  or rock to dig a hole four feet across  and three  feet deep.  Try to make  the hole in a damp  area to increase  the water  catcher’s  productivity.  Place  your cup in the deepest  part of the hole.  Then  lay the tube in place  so that one end rests all the way in the cup and the rest of the line runs up — and out — the side of the hole.  Next,  cover  the hole with the plastic  sheet,  securing  the edges  of the plastic  with dirt and weighting  the sheet’s  center  down  with a rock.  The plastic  should  now form  a cone  (圆锥体 ) with 45-degree-angled  sides.  The low point  of the sheet  must  be centered  directly  over,  and no more  than three  inches  above,  the cup.  The solar  still works  by creating  a greenhouse  under  the plastic.  Ground  water  evaporates  (蒸发 ) and collects  on the sheet  until small  drops  of water  form,  run down  the material  and fall off into the cup. When  the container  is full, you can suck the refreshment  out through  the tube,  and won’t  have  to break  down  the still every  time you need  a drink.   32.

We were  respectful  of craft（技艺）and focused  on digging  into the characters  we were  going  to play.

We shared  the brief  that if you’re  fortunate  enough  to have  success,  you should    put something  back  — he with his Newman’s  Own  food and his Hole  in the Wall  camps  for kids who are seriously  ill, and me with Sundance  and the institute  and the festival.  Paul and I didn’t  see each other  all that regularly,  but sharing  that brought  us together.  We supported  each other  financially  and by showing  up at events.  I last saw him a few months  ago. He’d  been  in and out of the hospital.  He and I both knew  what  the deal was, and we didn’t  talk about  it.

The vehicle  — named  the Transition  – has two seats , four wheels  and wings  that fold up so it can be driven  like a car. The Transition,  which  flew at 1,400  feet for eight  minutes  last month,  can reach  around  70 miles  per hour on the road and 115 in the air. It flies using  a 23-gallon  tank of gas and bums  5 gallons  per hour in the air. On the ground,  it gets 35 miles  per gallon.  Around  100 people  have  already  put down  a $10,000  deposit  to get a Transition  when  they go on sale, and those  numbers  will likely  rise after Terrafugia  introduces    the Transition  to the public  later this week  at the New  York  Auto  Show.  But don’t  expect  it to show  up in too many  driveways.  It’s expected  to cost $279,000.  And it won’t  help if you’re  stuck  in traffic.  The car needs  a runway.  Inventors  have  been  trying  to make  flying  cars since  the 1930s,  according  to Robert  Mann,  an airline  industry  expert.  But Mann  thinks  Terrafugia  has come  closer  than anyone  to making  the flying  car a reality.  The govemment  has already  permitted  the company  to use special  materials  to make  it easier  for the vehicle  to fly. The Transition  is now going  through  crash  tests to make  sure it meets  federal  safety  standards.

Back  in 1983,  two scientists,  Jack Schultz  and Ian Baldwin,  reported  that young  maple  trees  getting  bitten  by insects  send out a particular  smell  that neighboring  plants  can get. These    chemicals  come  from  the injured  parts  of the plant  and seem  to be an alarm.  What  the plants  pump  through  the air is a mixture  of chemicals  known  as volatile  organic  compounds,  VOCs  for short.  Scientists  have  found  that all kinds  of plants  give out VOCs  when  being  attacked.  It’s a plant’s  way of crying  out. But is anyone  listening?  Apparently.  Because  we can watch  the neighbours  react.  Some  plants  pump  out smelly  chemicals  to keep  insects  away.  But others  do double  duty.  They  pump  out perfumes  designed  to attract  different  insects  who are natural  enemies  to the attackers.  Once  they arrive,  the tables  are turned . The attacker  who was lunching  now becomes  lunch.  In study  after study,  it appears  that these  chemical  conversations  help the neighbors.  The damage  is usually  more  serious  on the first plant,  but the neighbors,  relatively  speaking,  stay safer  because  they heard  the alarm  and knew  what  to do. Does  this mean  that plants  talk to each other?  Scientists  don’t  know.  Maybe  the first plant  just made  a cry of pain or was sending  a message  to its own branches,  and so, in effect,  was talking  to itself.  Perhaps  the neighbors  just happened  to “overhear”  the cry. So information  was exchanged,  but it wasn’t  a true, intentional  back  and forth.  Charles  Darwin,  over 150 years  ago, imagined  a world  far busier,  noisier  and more  intimate  (亲密的 ) than the world  we can see and hear.  Our senses  are weak.  There’s  a whole  lot going  on. 32. What  does a plant  do when  it is under  attack?  A. It makes  noises.      B. It gets help from  other  plants.  C. It stands  quietly      D. It sends  out certain  chemicals.  33. What  does the author  mean  by “the tables  are turned”  in paragraph  3? A. The attackers  get attacked.  B. The insects  gather  under  the table.  C. The plants  get ready  to fight  back.  D. The perfumes  attract  natural  enemies.  34. Scientists  find from  their studies  that plants  can           .   A. predict  natural  disasters            B. protect  themselves  against  insects  C. talk to one another  intentionally      D. help their neighbors  when  necessary  35.

It was a scene that had been repeated many times in the theater’s 75-year history. This time, however, the cleanup was a little different. As one group of workers carried out the rubbish, another group began removing seats and other theater equipment in preparation for the building’s end.The film classic The Last Picture Show was the last movie shown in the old theater. Though the movie is 30 years old, most of the 250 seats were filled with teary-eyed audience wanting to say good-bye to the old building. Theater owner Ed Bradford said he chose the movie because it seemed appropriate. The movie is set in a small town where the only movie theater is preparing to close down.Bradford said that large modern theaters in the city made it impossible for the Plaza to compete. He added that the theater’s location (位置) was also a reason. “This used to be the center of town,” he said. “Now the area is mostly office buildings and warehouses.”Last week some city officials suggested the city might be interested in turning the old theater into a museum and public meeting place. However, these plans were abandoned because of financial problems. Bradford sold the building and land to a local development firm, which plans to build a shopping complex on the land where the theater is located.The theater audience said good-bye as Bradford locked the doors for the last time.

Fourteen wolves were caught in Canada and transported to the park. By last year, the Yellowstone wolf population had grown to more than 170 wolves.Gray wolves once were seen here and there in the Yellowstone area and much of the continental United States, but they were gradually displaced by human development. By the 1920s, wolves had practically disappeared from the Yellowstone area. They went farther north into the deep forests of Canada, where there were fewer humans around.The disappearance of the wolves had many unexpected results. Deer and elk populations — major food sources (来源) for the wolf — grew rapidly. These animals consumed large amounts of vegetation (植被), which reduced plant diversity in the park. In the absence of wolves, coyote populations also grew quickly. The coyotes killed a large percentage of the park’s red foxes, and completely drove away the park’s beavers.As early as 1966, biologists asked the government to consider reintroducing wolves to Yellowstone Park. They hoped that wolves would be able to control the elk and coyote problems. Many farmers opposed the plan because they feared that wolves would kill their farm animals or pets.    The government spent nearly 30 years coming up with a plan to reintroduce the wolvers. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service carefully monitors and manages the wolf packs in Yellowstone. Today, the debate continues over how well the gray wolf is fitting in at Yellowstone. Elk, deer, and coyote populations are down, while beavers and red fores have made a comeback. The Yellowstone wolf project has been a valuable experiment to help biologists decide whether to reintroduce wolves to other parts of the country as well.28. What is the text mainly about?A.

Phil Blythe explains: “For many older people, particularly those living alone or in the country, driving is important for preserving their independence, giving them the freedom to get out and about without having to rely on others.”“But we all have to accept that as we get older our reactions slow down and this often results in people avoiding any potentially challenging driving conditions and losing confidence in their driving skills. The result is that people stop driving before they really need to.”Dr Amy Guo, the leading researcher on the older driver study, explains, “The Drive LAB is helping us to understand what the key points and difficulties are for older drivers and how we might use technology to address these problems.“For example, most of us would expect older drivers always go slower than everyone else but surprisingly, we found that in 30mph zones they struggled to keep at a constant speed and so were more likely to break the speed limit and be at risk of getting fined. We’re looking at the benefits of systems which control their speed as a way of preventing that.“We hope that our work will help with technological solutions (解决方案) to ensure that older drivers stay safer behind the wheel.”32.

When  the the world  was still   populated  by hunter-gatherers,  small,  tightly  knit (联系 ) groups  developed  their own patterns  of speech  independent  of each other.  Some  language  experts  believe  that 10,000  years  ago, when  the world  had just five to ten million  people,  they spoke  perhaps  12,000  languages  between  them.  Soon  afterwards,  many  of those  people  started  settling  down  to become  farmers,  and their languages  too became  more  settled  and fewer  in number.  In recent  centres,  trade,  industrialisation , the development  of the nation-state  and the spread  of universal  compulsory  education.  Especially  glbalisation  and better  communications  in the past few decades,  all have  caused  many  Languages  to disappear,  and dominant  languages  such as English . Spanish  and Chinese  are increasingly  taking  over.  At present,  the world  has about  6,800 languages.  The distribution  of these  languages  is hugely  uneven.  The general  rule is that mild zones  have  relatively  few languages.  Often  spoken  by many  people  while  hot, wet zones  have  lots, often  spoken  by small  numbers.  Europe  has only around  200 Languages:  the Americas  about  1,000.  Africa  2,400; and Asia and the Pacific  perhaps  3,200,  of which  Papua  New  Guinea  alone  accounts  for well over 800. The median  number  (中位数 ) of speakers  is a mere  6.000,  which  means  that half the worlds  languages  are spoken  by fewer  people  than that. Already  well over 400 of the total of 6,800  languages  are close  to extinction( 消亡), with only a few elderly  speakers  left. Pick,  at random,  Busuu  in Cameroon  (eight  remaining  speakers),  Chiapaneco  in Mexico(150).  Lipan  Apache  in the United  States  (two or three)  or Wadjigu  in Australia  (one,  with a question-mark):  none  of these  seems  to have  much  chance  of survival.  28.

That’s  bad news  for the environment  — and our wallets  — as these  outdated  devices  consume  much  more  energy  than the newer  ones that do the same  things.  To figure  out how much  power  these  devices  are using,  Callie  Babbitt  and her colleagues  at the Rochester  Institute  of Technology  in New  York  tracked  the environmental  costs  for each product  throughout  its life — from  when  its minerals  are mined  to when  we stop using  the device.  This method  provided  a readout  for how home  energy  use has evolved  since  the early  1990s.  Devices  were  grouped  by generation  — Desktop  computers,  basic  mobile  phones,  and box-set  TVs defined  1992.  Digital  cameras  arrived  on the scene  in 1997.  And MP3  players,  smart  phones,  and LCD  TVs entered  homes  in 2002,  before  tablets  and e-readers  showed  up in 2007.  As we accumulated  more  devices,  however,  we didn ’t throw  out our old ones.  “The living-room  television  is replaced  and gets planted  in the kids’ room,  and suddenly  one day, you have  a TV in every  room  of the house, ” said one researcher.  The average  number  of electronic  devices  rose from  four per household  in 1992  to 13 in 2007.  We’re not just keeping  these  old devices  — we continue  to use them.  According  to the analysis  of Babbitt ’s team,  old desktop  monitors  and box TVs with cathode  ray tubes  are the worst  devices  with their energy  consumption  and contribution  to greenhouse  gas emissions （排放） more  than doubling  during  the 1992  to 2007  window.    So what ’s the solution（解决方案） ? The team ’s data only went  up to 2007,  but the researchers  also explored  what  would  happen  if consumers  replaced  old products  with new electronics  that serve  more  than one function,  such as a tablet  for word  processing  and TV viewing.  They  found  that more  on-demand  entertainment  viewing  on tablets  instead  of TVs and desktop  computers  could  cut energy  consumption  by 44%.  32. What  does the author  think  of new devices?  A. They  are environment-friendly.   B. They  are no better  than the old. C. They  cost more  to use at home.   D. They  go out of style  quickly.  33. Why  did Babbitt's  team  conduct  the research?  A. To reduce  the cost of minerals.  B. To test the life cycle  of a product.  C. To update  consumers  on new technology.  D. To find out electricity  consumption  of the devices.  34. Which  of the following  uses the least energy?  A. The box-set  TV.    B. The tablet.  C. The LCD  TV.    D. The desktop  computer.  35.

These  colourful  and sweet  jewels  from  British  Columbia’s  fields  are little powerhouses  of nutritional  protection.  Of the common  berries,  strawberries  are highest  in vitamin  C, although,  because  of their seeds,  raspberries  contain  a little more  protein  (蛋白质 ), iron and zinc (not that fruits  have  much  protein).  Blueberries  are particularly  high in antioxidants  (抗氧化 物 质 ). The yellow  and orange  stone  fruits  such as peaches  are high in the carotenoids  we turn into vitamin  A and which  are antioxidants.  As for cherries  (樱桃), they are so delicious  who cares?  However,  they are rich in vitamin  C. When  combined  with berries  or slices  of other  fruits,  frozen  bananas  make  an excellent  base for thick,  cooling  fruit shakes  and low fat “ice cream”.  For this purpose,  select  ripe bananas  for freezing  as they are much  sweeter.  Remove  the skin and place  them  in plastic  bags or containers  and freeze.  If you like, a squeeze  of fresh  lemon  juice  on the bananas  will prevent  them  turning  brown.  Frozen  bananas  will last several  weeks,  depending  on their ripeness  and the temperature  of the freezer.  If you have  a juicer , you can simply  feed in frozen  bananas  and some  berries  or sliced  fruit.  Out comes  a “soft-serve”  creamy  dessert,  to be eaten  right  away.

While  the decline  over the past decade  is steep  for teen readers,  some  data in the report  shows  that reading  remains  a big part of many  children’s  lives,  and indicates  how parents  might  help encourage  more  reading.  According  to the report’s  key findings,  “the proportion  (比例 ) who say they ‘hardly  ever’  read for fun has gone  from  8 percent  of 13-year-olds  and 9 percent  of 17-year-olds  in 1984  to 22 percent  and 27 percent  respectively  today.”  The report  data shows  that pleasure  reading  levels  for younger  children,  ages 2-8, remain  largely  the same.  But the amount  of time spent  in reading  each session  has declined,  from  closer  to an hour or more  to closer  to a half hour per session.  When  it comes  to technology  and reading,  the report  does little to counsel  (建议) parents  looking  for data about  the effect  of e-readers  and tablets  on reading.  It does point  out that many  parents  still limit  electronic  reading,  mainly  due to concerns  about  increased  screen  time.  The most  hopeful  data shared  in the report  shows  clear  evidence  of parents  serving  as examples  and important  guides  for their kids when  it comes  to reading.  Data  shows  that kids and teens  who do read frequently,  compared  to infrequent  readers,  have  more  books  in the home,  more  books  purchased  for them,  parents  who read more  often,  and parents  who set aside  time for them  to read.  As the end of school  approaches,  and school  vacation  reading  lists loom  (逼近 ) ahead,  parents  might  take this chance  to step in and make  their own summer  reading  list and plan a family  trip to the library  or bookstore.  28.

What’s  the problem?  It’s possible  that we all have  compromised  conversational  intelligence.  It’s more  likely  that none  of us start a conversation  because  it’s awkward  and challenging,  or we think  it’s annoying  and unnecessary.  But the next time you find yourself  among  strangers,  consider  that small  talk is worth  the trouble.  Experts  say it’s an invaluable  social  practice  that results  in big benefits.  Dismissing  small  talk as unimportant  is easy,  but we can’t  forget  that deep  relationships  wouldn’t  even  exist  if it weren’t  for casual  conversation.  Small  talk is the grease  (润滑剂 ) for social  communication,  says Bernardo  Carducci,  director  of the Shyness  Research  Institute  at Indiana  University  Southeast.  “Almost  every  great  love story  and each big business  deal begins  with small  talk,”  he explains.  “The  key to successful  small  talk is learning  how to connect  with others,  not just communicate  with them.”  In a 2014  study,  Elizabeth  Dunn,  associate  professor  of psychology  at UBC,  invited  people  on their way into a coffee  shop.  One group  was asked  to seek out an interaction  (互动 ) with its waiter;  the other,  to speak  only when  necessary.  The results  showed  that those  who chatted  with their server  reported  significantly  higher  positive  feelings  and a better  coffee  shop  experience.  “It’s not that talking  to the waiter  is better  than talking  to your husband,”  say Dunn.  “But  interactions  with peripheral  (边缘的 ) members  of our social  network  matter  for our well-being  also.”  Dunn  believes  that people  who reach  out to strangers  feel a significantly  greater  sense  of belonging,  a bond  with others.  Carducci  believes  developing  such a sense  of belonging  starts  with small  talk. “Small  talk is the basis  of good  manners,”  he says.  32. What  phenomenon  is described  in the first paragraph?  A. Addiction  to smartphones.  B. Inappropriate  behaviours  in public  places.  C. Absence  of communication  between  strangers.  D. Impatience  with slow  service.  33. What  is important  for successful  small  talk according  to Carducci?  A. Showing  good  manners.     B. Relating  to other  people.  C. Focusing  on a topic.      D. Making  business  deals.  34. What  does the coffee-shop  study  suggest  about  small  talk?  A. It improves  family  relationships.   B. It raises  people’s  confidence.  C. It matters  as much  as formal  talk.  D. It makes  people  feel good.  35. What  is the best title for the text?  A. Conversation  Counts      B.

Over 300 years its population grew gradually from 800 people to 8 million. But not all cities develop slowly over a long period of time. Boom towns grow from nothing almost overnight. In 1896, Dawson, Canada, was unmapped wilderness (荒野). But gold was discovered there in 1897, and two years later, it was one of the largest cities in the West, with a population of 30,000.Dawson did not have any of the natural conveniences of cities like London or Paris. People went there for gold. They travelled over snow-covered mountains and sailed hundreds of miles up icy rivers. The path to Dawson was covered with thirty feet of wet snow that could fall without warming. An avalanche(雪崩) once closed the path, killing 63 people. For many who made it to Dawson, however, the rewards were worth the difficult trip. Of the first 20,000 people who dug for gold, 4,000 got rich. About 100 of these stayed rich men for the rest of their lives.But no matter how rich they were, Dawson was never comfortable. Necessities like food and wood were very expensive. But soon, the gold that Dawson depended on had all been found. The city was crowded with disappointed people with no interest in settling down, and when they heard there were new gold discoveries in Alaska, they left Dawson City as quickly as they had come.

He asked the workers to use traditional techniques to make the bricks into walls, roofs and corridors. This creation attracted a lot of attention thanks to its mixture of modern and traditional Chinese elements (元素).Wang’s works show a deep understanding of modern architecture and a good knowledge of traditions. Through such a balance, he had created a new type of Chinese architecture, said Tadao Ando, the winner of the 1995 Pritzker Prize.Wang believes traditions should not be sealed in glass boxes at museums. “That is only evidence that traditions once existed,” he said.“Many Chinese people have a misunderstanding of traditions. They think tradition means old things from the past. In fact, tradition also refers to the things that have been developing and that are still being created,” he said.“Today, many Chinese people are learning Western styles and theories rather than focusing on Chinese traditions. Many people tend to talk about traditions without knowing what they really are,” said Wang.学K]The study of traditions should be combined with practice. Otherwise, the recreation of traditions would be artificial and empty, he said.28.

I found the pre-holidays a good time to encourage young children to donate less-used things, and it worked. Because of our efforts, our daughter Georgia did decide to donate a large bag of toys to a little girl whose mother was unable to pay for her holiday due to illness. She chose to sell a few larger objects that were less often used when we promised to put the money into her school fund (基金) (our kindergarten daughter is serious about becoming a doctor).For weeks, I’ve been thinking of bigger, deeper questions: How do we make it a habit for them? And how do we train ourselves to help them live with, need, and use less? Yesterday, I sat with my son, Shepherd, determined to test my own theory on this. I decided to play with him with only one toy for as long as it would keep his interest. I expected that one toy would keep his attention for about five minutes, ten minutes, max. I chose a red rubber ball—simple, universally available. We passed it, he tried to put it in his mouth, he tried bouncing it, rolling it, sitting on it, throwing it. It was totally, completely enough for him. Before I knew it an hour had passed and it was time to move on to lunch.We both became absorbed in the simplicity of playing together.

Whaley recalls(回想起)how at the beginning of the year，when called upon to read，Chris would excuse himself to go to the bathroom.Learning English as a second language can be a painful experience. What you need is a great teacher who lets you make mistakes. “It takes a lot for any student，” Whaley explains，“especially for a student who is learning English as their new language，to feel confident enough to say，‘I don’t know，but I want to know.’”Whaley got the idea of this second-grade presidential campaign project when he asked the children one day to raise their hands if they thought they could never be a president. The answer broke his heart. Whaley says the project is about more than just learning to read and speak in public. He wants these kids to learn to boast(夸耀)about themselves.“Boasting about yourself，and your best qualities,” Whaley says，“is very difficult for a child who came into the classroom not feeling confident.”24.

Thus, the keyboard can determine people's identities, and by extension, whether they should be given access to the computer it's connected to—regardless of whether someone gets the password right.It also doesn't require a new type of technology that people aren't already familiar with. Everybody uses a keyboard and everybody types differently.In a study describing the technology, the researchers had 100 volunteers type the word “touch”four times using the smart keyboard. Data collected from the device could be used to recognize different participants based on how they typed, with very low error rates. The researchers say that the keyboard should be pretty straightforward to commercialize and is mostly made of inexpensive, plastic-like parts. The team hopes to make it to market in the near future.28. Why do the researchers develop the smart keyboard?A. To reduce pressure on keys.\tB. To improve accuracy in typingC. To replace the password system.\tD. To cut the cost of e-space protection.29. What makes the invention of the smart keyboard possible？A. Computers are much easier to operate.B.

I was the queen of the playground. Then came my tweens and teens, and mean girls and cool kids. They rose in the ranks not by being friendly but by smoking cigarettes, breaking rules and playing jokes on others, among whom I soon found myself.Popularity is a well-explored subject in social psychology. Mitch Prinstein, a professor of clinical psychology sorts the popular into two categories: the likable and the status seekers. The likables’ plays-well-with-others qualities strengthen schoolyard friendships, jump-start interpersonal skills and, when tapped early, are employed ever after in life and work. Then there’s the kind of popularity that appears in adolescence: status born of power and even dishonorable behavior.Enviable as the cool kids may have seemed, Dr. Prinstein’s studies show unpleasant consequences. Those who were highest in status in high school, as well as those least liked in elementary school, are “most likely to engage(从事)in dangerous and risky behavior.”In one study, Dr. Prinstein examined the two types of popularity in 235 adolescents, scoring the least liked, the most liked and the highest in status based on student surveys(调查研究). “We found that the least well-liked teens had become more aggressive over time toward their classmates. But so had those who were high in status. It clearly showed that while likability can lead to healthy adjustment, high status has just the opposite effect on us.\"Dr. Prinstein has also found that the qualities that made the neighbors want you on a play date-sharing, kindness, openness — carry over to later years and make you better able to relate and connect with others.In analyzing his and other research，Dr. Prinstein came to another conclusion: Not only is likability related to positive life outcomes, but it is also responsible for those outcomes, too. \"Being liked creates opportunities for learning and for new kinds of life experiences that help somebody gain an advantage, ” he said.32.

She may just need a little persuading. So I try again and tug at the heartstrings. I mention the single parent with four kids running the show and I talk about the dad coaching a team that his kids aren’t even on … At this point the unwilling parent speaks up,“Alright. Yes, I’ll do it.”I’m secretly relieved because I know there’s real power in sharing volunteer responsibilities among many. The unwilling parent organizes the meal schedule, sends out emails, and collects money for end-of-season gifts. Somewhere along the way, the same parent ends up becoming an invaluable member of the team. The coach is able to focus on the kids while the other parents are relieved to be off the hook for another season. Handing out sliced oranges to bloodthirsty kids can be as exciting as watching your own kid score a goal.Still, most of us volunteers breathe a sigh of relief when the season comes to a close. That relief is coupled with a deep understanding of why the same people keep coming back for more: Connecting to the community(社区)as you freely give your time, money, skills, or services provides a real joy.

What is she reading? None of your business! Lunch is Bechtel’s “me” time. And like more Americans, she’s not alone.A new report found 46 percent of meals are eaten alone in America. More than half(53 percent)have breakfast alone and nearly half(46 percent)have lunch by themselves. Only at dinnertime are we eating together anymore，74 percent，according to statistics from the report.“I prefer to go out and be out. Alone，but together，you know？”Bechtel said，looking up from her book. Bechtel，who works in downtown West Palm Beach，has lunch with coworkers sometimes，but like many of us，too often works through lunch at her desk. A lunchtime escape allows her to keep a boss from tapping her on the shoulder. She returns to work feeling energized. “Today，I just wanted some time to myself，”she said.Just two seats over，Andrew Mazoleny，a local videographer，is finishing his lunch at the bar. He likes that he can sit and check his phone in peace or chat up the barkeeper with whom he's on a first-name basis if he wants to have a little interaction(交流). “I reflect on how my day's gone and think about the rest of the week,” he said. “It's a chance for self-reflection, You return to work recharged and with a plan.”That freedom to choose is one reason more people like to eat alone. There was a time when people may have felt awkward about asking for a table for one，but those days are over. Now，we have our smartphones to keep us company at the table. “It doesn't feel as alone as it may have before al the advances in technology,” said Laurie Demerit， whose company provided the statistics for the report.28.

Today $8 or $10 seems a small amount of money, but at that time these amounts were forbidding to most citizens. Accordingly, newspapers were read almost only by rich people in politics or the trades. In addition, most newspapers had little in them that would appeal to a mass audience. They were dull and visually forbidding. But the revolution that was taking place in the 1830s would change all that.The trend, then, was toward the \"penny paper\"-a term referring to papers made widely available to the public. It meant any inexpensive newspaper; perhaps more importantly it meant newspapers that could be bought in single copies on the street.This development did not take place overnight. It had been possible(but not easy)to buy single copies of newspapers before 1830,but this usually meant the reader had to go down to the printer's office to purchase a copy. Street sales were almost unknown. However, within a few years, street sales of newspapers would be commonplace in eastern cities. At first the price of single copies was seldom a penny-usually two or three cents was charged-and some of the older well-known papers charged five or six cents. But the phrase \"penny paper \" caught the public's fancy, and soon there would be papers that did indeed sell for only a penny.This new trend of newspapers for \"the man on the street\" did not begin well. Some of the early ventures(企业)were immediate failures. Publishers already in business, people who were owners of successful papers, had little desire to change the tradition. It took a few youthful and daring businessmen to get the ball rolling.28. Which of the following best describes newspapers in America before the 1830s?A. Academic.\tB. Unattractive.\tC. Inexpensive.\tD. Confidential.29. What did street sales mean to newspapers?A. They would be priced higher.\tB. They would disappear from cities.C. They could have more readers.\tD.

Accordingly newspapers were read almost only by rich people. In addition ,most newspapers had little in them that would appeal to mass audience. They were dull and visually forbidding.”可知，在19世纪30年代之前,只有富人才能读报纸，而且大多数报纸中几乎没有能吸引大众的内容，让人感觉无聊，，视觉上令人望而却步。由此可得出那时的报纸没有什么吸引力。分析选项，A . Academic学术的；B. Unattractive没有吸引力， 无魅力的； C. Inexpensive廉价的，不贵的； D. Confidential机密的，保密的。可知 A、C和D是错误的，只有B符合题意，故选B。【29题详解】推理判断题。根据第二段提到“便士报纸”针对大众，很便宜的。更重要的是，在街上可以买的到报纸。 结合第三段中间的“streets sales of newspapers would be commonplaced in eastern cities”可知，报纸的街头销售随处可见。由此可推断出，街头销售意味读报纸的多了。分析选项可知C符合题，故选C。【30题详解】细节理解题。根据第二段中的“The trend, then, was ‘penny paper’—a term referring to papers made widely available to the public. perhaps more importantly it meant newspapers that could be bought in single copies on the street.”可知，这种“便士报纸”针对大众的，在街上可以买的到报纸。分析选项可知，选项B符合题意，故选B。【31题详解】推理判断题。第二段“The trend, then, was ‘penny paper’”及最后一段“The new trend of newspapers for ‘the man on the street’ did not begin well.

It took a few youthful and daring businessmen to get the ball rolling.”可知，“便士报纸”新趋势一开始并不好，一些早期的尝试立即失败了。已经进入商业领域的成功的出版商，并不想改变这一传统。后来一些年轻而大胆的商人才推动了这件事。由此可推断出“便士报纸”的诞生是一个困难而曲折的过程。分析选项可知，A项符合题意，故选A。", "modality": "t", "image_urls": [], "inference": "{\n\"type\":\"概念题\",\n\"analysis\":[\n\t[\"新闻报纸在美国之前的1830年，主要通过年度订阅销售，价格大约为8美元到10美元。因此，新闻报纸在那时候对大多数公民来说是一个庞大的金额。因此，新闻报纸几乎只被富人政治人物和商业人士所读。此外，大多数新闻报纸内容不具有广泛受众的吸引力，它们是枯燥的，视觉上也令人寒心。但是，1830年之后正在发生的革命将会改变一切。趋势是向“分钱报纸”-这是指可以广泛向公众提供的报纸，也是指可以在街上单独购买的廉价报纸。这种发展并不是一夜之间发生的。在1830年之前，单独购买报纸是可能的，但是这通常意味着读者必须前往印刷商店购买一份。街上的销售几乎是不可知的。但是，在东部城市内，新闻报纸的街上销售很快就会成为常见的。初始单独报纸的价格通常不是一分-通常会收取两个或三个美分，而一些老牌成功的报纸会收取五美分或六美分。但是，“分钱报纸”这个词语吸引了公众的注意，很快就会有报纸可以只卖一分。这种对“街上的人”的新闻报纸的趋势并不是一个好开端。一些早期的企业是立即失败的。已经在业务上的出版商，成功的报纸所有者，对于改变传统并不感兴趣。需要一些勇敢的年轻商人来开始这一行动。\"],\n\t[\"新闻报纸在美国之前的1830年，主要是通过年度订阅销售的，价格大约为8美元到10美元。因此，新闻报纸在那时候对大多数公民来说是一个庞大的金额，因此，新闻报纸几乎只被富人政治人物和商业人士所读。此外，大多数新闻报纸内容不具有广泛受众的吸引力，它们是枯燥的，视觉上也令人寒心。但是，1830年之后正在发生的革命将会改变一切。趋势是向“分钱报纸”-这是指可以广泛向公众提供的报纸，也是指可以在街上单独购买的廉价报纸。这种发展并不是一夜之间发生的。在1830年之前，单独购买报纸是可能的，但是这通常意味着读者必须前往印刷商店购买一份。街上的销售几乎是不可知的。但是，在东部城市内，新闻报纸的街上销售很快就会成为常见的。初始单独报纸的价格通常不是一分-通常会收取两个或三个美分，而一些老牌成功的报纸会收取五美分或六美分。但是，“分钱报纸”这个词语吸引了公众的注意，很快就会有报纸可以只卖一分。这种对“街上的人”的新闻报纸的趋势并不是一个好开端。", "rating": "{ \"is_correct\": false, \"correctness_score\": 0, \"completeness_score\": 0, \"innovation_score\": 0, \"reasoning_score\": 0, \"student_level\": \"大学\"}"}

The researchers then tested how the monkeys combined—or added—the symbols to get the reward.Here's how Harvard Medical School scientist Margaret Livingstone, who led the team, described the experiment: In their cages the monkeys were provided with touch screens. On one part of the screen, a symbol would appear, and on the other side two symbols inside a circle were shown. For example, the number 7 would flash on one side of the screen and the other end would have 9 and 8. If the monkeys touched the left side of the screen they would be rewarded with seven drops of water or juice; if they went for the circle, they would be rewarded with the sum of the numbers—17 in this example.After running hundreds of tests, the researchers noted that the monkeys would go for the higher values more than half the time, indicating that they were performing a calculation, not just memorizing the value of each combination.When the team examined the results of the experiment more closely, they noticed that the monkeys tended to underestimate(低估)a sum compared with a single symbol when the two were close in value—sometimes choosing, for example, a 13 over the sum of 8 and 6. The underestimation was systematic: When adding two numbers, the monkeys always paid attention to the larger of the two, and then added only a fraction(小部分)of the smaller number to it.\"This indicates that there is a certain way quantity is represented in their brains, \"Dr. Livingstone says. “But in this experiment what they're doing is paying more attention to the big number than the little one.”32.

It does, however, have its own problem.Race walkers are conditioned athletes. The longest track and field event at the Summer Olympics is the 50-kilometer race walk, which is about five miles longer than the marathon. But the sport’s rules require that a race walker’s knees stay straight through most of the leg swing and one foot remain in contact (接触) with the ground at all times. It’s this strange form that makes race walking such an attractive activity, however, says Jaclyn Norberg, an assistant professor of exercise science at Salem State University in Salem, Mass.Like running, race walking is physically demanding, she says, According to most calculations, race walkers moving at a pace of six miles per hour would burn about 800 calories(卡路里) per hour, which is approximately twice as many as they would burn walking, although fewer than running, which would probably burn about 1,000 or more calories per hour.However, race walking does not pound the body as much as running does, Dr. Norberg says. According to her research, runners hit the ground with as much as four times their body weight per step, while race walkers, who do not leave the ground, create only about 1.4 times their body weight with each step.As a result, she says, some of the injuries associated with running, such as runner’s knee, are uncommon among race walkers. But the sport’s strange form does place considerable stress on the ankles and hips, so people with a history of such injuries might want to be cautious in adopting the sport. In fact, anyone wishing to try race walking should probably first consult a coach or experienced racer to learn proper technique, she says. It takes some practice.28. Why are race walkers conditioned athletes?A. They must run long distances.B. They are qualified for the marathon.C. They have to follow special rules.D. They are good at swinging their legs.29. What advantage does race walking have over running?A. It’s more popular at the Olympics.B. It’s less challenging physically.C. It’s more effective in body building.D. It’s less likely to cause knee injuries.30. What is Dr. Norberg’s suggestion for someone trying race walking?A. Getting experts’ opinions.B. Having a medical checkup.C. Hiring an experienced coach.D.

These include plants that have sensors printed onto their leaves to show when they’re short of water and a plant that can detect harmful chemicals in groundwater. ＂We’re thinking about how we can engineer plants to replace functions of the things that we use every day,＂explained Michael Strano, a professor of chemical engineering at MIT.One of his latest projects has been to make plants glow(发光)in experiments using some common vegetables. Strano’s team found that they could create a faint light for three-and-a-half hours. The light，about one-thousandth of the amount needed to read by，is just a start. The technology, Strano said, could one day be used to light the rooms or even to turn tree into self-powered street lamps.in the future，the team hopes to develop a version of the technology that can be sprayed onto plant leaves in a one-off treatment that would last the plant’s lifetime. The engineers are also trying to develop an on and off＂switch＂where the glow would fade when exposed to daylight.Lighting accounts for about 7% of the total electricity consumed in the US. Since lighting is often far removed from the power source(电源)-such as the distance from a power plant to street lamps on a remote highway-a lot of energy is lost during transmission(传输).Glowing plants could reduce this distance and therefore help save energy.32.

But some ecologists and fashion (时装)enthusiasts are trying to bring back the market for fur made from nutria(海狸鼠).Unusual fashion shows in New Orleans and Brooklyn have showcased nutria fur made into clothes in different styles. “It sounds crazy to talk about guilt-free fur-unless you understand that the nutria are destroying vast wetlands every year”, says Cree McCree, project director of Righteous Fur.Scientists in Louisiana were so concerned that they decided to pay hunters $5 a tail. Some of the fur ends up in the fashion shows like the one in Brooklyn last month.Nutria were brought there from Argentina by fur farmers and let go into the wild. “The ecosystem down there can’t handle this non-native species(物种).It’s destroying the environment. It’s them or us.” says Michael Massimi, an expert in this field.The fur trade kept nutria in check for decades，but when the market for nutria collapsed in the late 1980s，the cat-sized animals multiplied like crazy.Biologist Edmond Mouton runs the nutria control program for Louisiana. He says it’s not easy to convince people that nutria fur is green, but he has no doubt about it. Hunters bring in more than 300,000 nutria tails a year, so part of Mouton’s job these days is trying to promote fur.Then there’s Righteous Fur and its unusual fashion. Model Paige Morgan says，”To give people a guilt-free option that they can wear without someone throwing paint on them-1 think that’s going to be a massive thing, at least here in New York.” Designer Jennifer Anderson admits it took her a while to come around to the opinion that using nutria fur for her creations is morally acceptable. She trying to come up with a lable to attach to nutria fashions to show it is eco-friendly.28. What is the purpose of the fashion shows in New Orleans and Brooklyn?A. To promote guilt-free fur.B. To expand the fashion market.C. To introduce a new brand.D. To celebrate a winter holiday.29. Why are scientists concerned about nutria?A. Nutria damage the ecosystem seriously.B. Nutria are an endangered species.C. Nutria hurt local cat-sized animals.D. Nutria are illegally hunted.30. What does the underlined word “collapsed” in paragraph 5 probably mean?A. Boomed.\tB.

But they weren’t there to throw red paint on fur-coat-wearing film stars. Instead, one activist, dressed in a full-body monkey suit, had arrived with a sign praising the filmmakers: “Thanks for not using real apes (猿)!”The creative team behind “Apes” used motion-capture (动作捕捉) technology to create digitalized animals, spending tens of millions of dollars on technology that records an actor’s performance and later processes it with computer graphics to create a final image (图像). In this case, one of a realistic-looking ape.Yet “Apes” is more exception than the rule. In fact, Hollywood has been hot on live animals lately. One nonprofit organization, which monitors the treatment of animals in filmed entertainment, is keeping tabs on more than 2,000 productions this year. Already, a number of films, including “Water for Elephants,” “The Hangover Part Ⅱ” and “Zookeeper,” have drawn the anger of activists who say the creatures acting in them haven’t been treated properly.In some cases, it’s not so much the treatment of the animals on set in the studio that has activists worried; it’s the off-set training and living conditions that are raising concerns. And there are questions about the films made outside the States, which sometimes are not monitored as closely as productions filmed in the States.24. Why did the animal activists gather on Hollywood Boulevard?A. To see famous film stars.B. To oppose wearing fur coats.C. To raise money for animal protection.D. To express thanks to some filmmakers.25 What does paragraph 2 mainly talk about?A. The cost of making “Apes.”B. The creation of digitalized apes.C. The publicity about “Apes.”D.

And there are questions about the films made outside the States, which sometimes are not monitored as closely as productions filmed in the Sates.”（在某些情况下，让活动人士担心的并不是电影棚里对动物的待遇;让人担忧的是训练和生活条件。还有一些关于在美国以外拍摄的电影的问题，这些电影有时不像在美国拍摄的电影那样受到严密的监控。）可知，在某些情况下，让活动人士担心的并不是工作室里动物的待遇;令人担忧的是训练和生活条件。由此判断出动物演员可能受到虐待。故选A项。", "modality": "t", "image_urls": [], "inference": "{\n\"type\":\"概念题\",\n\"analysis\":[\n\t[\"The animal activists gathered on Hollywood Boulevard to express thanks to some filmmakers (D).\"],\n\t[\"Paragraph 2 mainly talks about the creation of digitalized apes (B).\"]\n],\n\"answer\":[\"D\",\"B\"]\n}\n\n{\n\"type\":\"词义题\",\n\"analysis\":[\n\t[\"The underlined phrase “keeping tabs on” in paragraph 3 probably means watching carefully (D).\"]\n],\n\"answer\":[\"D\"]\n}\n\n{\n\"type\":\"推理题\",\n\"analysis\":[\n\t[\"From the last paragraph, we can infer that animal actors may be badly treated (A).\"]\n],\n\"answer\":[\"A\"]\n}", "rating": "```json\n{\n  \"is_correct\": true,\n  \"correctness_score\": 2,\n  \"completeness_score\": 5,\n  \"innovation_score\": 3,\n  \"reasoning_score\": 5,\n  \"student_level\": \"高中\"\n}\n```"}

They share a front door and a washing machine, but Rita Whitehead has her own kitchen, bathroom, bedroom and living room on the ground floor.“We floated the idea to my mum of sharing at a house,” says Kathryn Whitehead. Rita cuts in: “We spoke more with Nick because I think it’s a big thing for Nick to live with his mother-in-law.”And what does Nick think? “From my standpoint, it all seems to work very well. Would I recommend it? Yes, I think I would.”It’s hard to tell exactly how many people agree with him, but research indicates that the numbers have been rising for some time. Official reports suggest that the number of households with three generations living together had risen from 325,000 in 2001to 419,000 in 2013.Other varieties of multigenerational family are more common. Some people live with their elderly parents; many more adult children are returning to the family home, if they ever left. It is said that about 20% of 25-34-year-olds live with their parents, compared with 16% in 1991.The total number of all multigenerational households in Britain is thought to be about 1.8 million.Stories like that are more common in parts of the world where multigenerational living is more firmly rooted.

In fact plenty of younger kids have one in their pocket. Practically everyone can make and receive calls anywhere, anytime. Still, 55 percent of Australians have a landline phone at home and only just over a quarter （29%） rely only on their smartphones according to a survey （调查）. Of those Australians who still have a landline, a third concede that it’s not really necessary and they’re keeping it as a security blanket — 19 percent say they never use it while a further 13 percent keep it in case of emergencies. I think my home falls into that category. More than half of Australian homes are still choosing to stick with their home phone. Age is naturally a factor（因素）— only 58 percent of Generation Ys still use landlines now and then, compared to 84 percent of Baby Boomers who’ve perhaps had the same home number for 50 years. Age isn’t the only factor; I’d say it’s also to do with the makeup of your household. Generation Xers with young families, like my wife and I, can still find it convenient to have a home phone rather than providing a mobile phone for every family member. That said, to be honest the only people who ever ring our home phone are our Baby Boomers parents, to the point where we play a game and guess who is calling before we pick up the phone（using Caller ID would take the fun out of it）.

In fact plenty of younger kids have one in their pocket. Practically everyone can make and receive calls anywhere, anytime. (现在你很难在澳大利亚找到15岁以上的没有手机的人。事实上，很多年幼的孩子口袋里都有手机。几乎每个人都可以随时随地拨打和接听电话)”可推知，本段主要说明手机在澳大利亚广受欢迎。故选B项。【25题详解】词句猜测题。根据划线单词的上文“Of those Australians who still have a landline (在那些仍然有固定电话的澳大利亚人中)”可知，这个调查的目标人群是仍然有固定电话的澳大利亚人；根据下文“it's not really necessary and they're keeping it as a security blanket — 19 percent say they never use it while a further 13 percent keep it in case of emergencies (固定电话并不是必须的，他们将其作为一种安全保障——19%的人表示他们从未使用过固定电话，另有13%的人保留固定电话以防紧急情况)”可知，很多人认为固定电话并不是必须拥有的，有些人保留固定电话只是为了防止紧急情况。从而推知，在调查中，他们应该是承认了固定电话的非必要性。由此推知，划线单词“concede”意为“承认”。故选A项。【26题详解】推理判断题。根据文章第四段“84 percent of Baby Boomers who've perhaps had the same home number for 50 years.(婴儿潮时代中有84%的人可能已经有50年相同的家庭号码了)”以及文章第五段“That said, to be honest the only people who ever ring our home phone are our Baby Boomers parents (也就是说，老实说，唯一打过我们家电话的人是婴儿潮一代的父母)”可推知，婴儿潮时代的人一直用固定电话。故选C项。【27题详解】推理判断题。根据文章最后一段“How attached are you to your landline? How long until they go the way of gas street lamps and morning milk deliveries? (你有多喜欢你的座机？它们还要多久才能走上煤气路灯和早晨送牛奶的道路？)”可推知，本段使用类比的方式，使用煤气路灯以及早晨送牛奶已经被淘汰的例子，侧面说明了固定电话总有一天会废弃的。故选B项。", "modality": "t", "image_urls": [], "inference": "{\n\"type\":\"概念题\",\n\"analysis\":[\n\t[\"该段落主要告诉我们移动电话的流行程度，并提供了有关为什么仍有超过一半的澳大利亚家庭拥有座机的信息。\"],\n\t[\"该段落主要描述了移动电话的流行程度，并提供了有关为什么仍有超过一半的澳大利亚家庭拥有座机的原因。\"]\n],\n\"answer\":\"该段落主要描述了移动电话的流行程度，并提供了有关为什么仍有超过一半的澳大利亚家庭拥有座机的原因。\"\n}\n{\n\"type\":\"概念题\",\n\"analysis\":[\n\t[\"该词语“concede”在这里意味着“承认”。\"],\n\t[\"该词语“concede”在这里意味着“认可”。\"]\n],\n\"answer\":\"该词语“concede”在这里意味着“承认”。\"\n}\n{\n\"type\":\"概念题\",\n\"analysis\":[\n\t[\"从最后一段可以推断出，老年人（Baby Boomers）仍在使用座机。\"],\n\t[\"从最后一段可以推断出，老年人（Baby Boomers）仍在使用座机。\"]\n],\n\"answer\":\"从最后一段可以推断出，老年人（Baby Boomers）仍在使用座机。\"\n}\n{\n\"type\":\"概念题\",\n\"analysis\":[\n\t[\"从最后一段可以推断出，座机可能会在未来逐渐失去使用。\"],\n\t[\"从最后一段可以推断出，座机可能会在未来逐渐失去使用。\"]\n],\n\"answer\":\"从最后一段可以推断出，座机可能会在未来逐渐失去使用。\"\n}", "rating": "{\"is_correct\": false, \"correctness_score\": 0, \"completeness_score\": 0, \"innovation_score\": 0, \"reasoning_score\": 0, \"student_level\": \"初中/高中\"}"}

But does one plastic straw or cup really make a difference? Artist Benjamin Von Wong wants you to know that it does. He builds massive sculptures out of plastic garbage, forcing viewers to re-examine their relationship to single-use plastic products. At the beginning of the year, the artist built a piece called “Strawpocalypse,” a pair of 10-foot-tall plastic waves, frozen mid-crash. Made of 168,000 plastic straws collected from several volunteer beach cleanups, the sculpture made its first appearance at the Estella Place shopping center in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Just 9% of global plastic waste is recycled. Plastic straws are by no means the biggest source（来源）of plastic pollution but they’ve recently come under fire because most people don’t need them to drink with and, because of their small size and weight, they cannot be recycled. Every straw that’s part of Von Wong’s artwork likely came from a drink that someone used for only a few minutes. Once the drink is gone, the straw will take centuries to disappear. In a piece from 2018, Von Wong wanted to illustrate（说明） a specific statistic: Every 60 seconds, a truckload’s worth of plastic enters the ocean. For this work, titled “Truckload of Plastic,” Von Wong and a group of volunteers collected more than 10,000 pieces of plastic, which were then tied together to look like they’d been dumped（倾倒） from a truck all at once.

Annoyed by the level of distraction（干扰）in his open office, he said, “That’s why I have a membership at the coworking space across the street — so I can focus”. His comment struck me as strange. After all, coworking spaces also typically use an open office layout（布局）. But I recently came across a study that shows why his approach works. The researchers examined various levels of noise on participants as they completed tests of creative thinking. They were randomly divided into four groups and exposed to various noise levels in the background, from total silence to 50 decibels（分贝）, 70 decibels, and 85 decibels. The differences between most of the groups were statistically insignificant; however, the participants in the 70 decibels group — those exposed to a level of noise similar to background chatter in a coffee shop — significantly outperformed the other groups. Since the effects were small, this may suggest that our creative thinking does not differ that much in response to total silence and 85 decibels of background noise. But since the results at 70 decibels were significant, the study also suggests that the right level of background noise — not too loud and not total silence — may actually improve one’s creative thinking ability. The right level of background noise may interrupt our normal patterns of thinking just enough to allow our imaginations to wander, without making it impossible to focus. This kind of “distracted focus” appears to be the best state for working on creative tasks. So why do so many of us hate our open offices? The problem may be that, in our offices, we can’t stop ourselves from getting drawn into others’ conversations while we’re trying to focus. Indeed, the researchers found that face-to-face interactions and conversations affect the creative process, and yet a coworking space or a coffee shop provides a certain level of noise while also providing freedom from interruptions.32 Why does the interviewer prefer a coworking space?A.

Everyone in the family settled quickly into the city except me. Without my beloved beaches and endless blue—sky days, I felt at a loss and out of place. Until I made a discovery.Southbank, at an eastern bend in the Thames, is the center of British skateboarding, where the continuous crashing of skateboards left your head ringing .I loved it. I soon made friends with the local skaters. We spoke our own language. And my favorite: Safe. Safe meant cool. It meant hello. It meant don't worry about it. Once, when trying a certain trick on the beam（横杆）, I fell onto the stones, damaging a nerve in my hand, and Toby came over, helping me up: Safe, man. Safe. A few minutes later, when I landed the trick, my friends beat their boards loud, shouting: “ Safe! Safe! Safe!” And that's what mattered—landing tricks, being a good skater.When I was 15, my family moved to Washington. I tried skateboarding there, but the locals were far less welcoming. Within a couple of years, I'd given it up.When I returned to London in 2004, I found myself wandering down to Southbank, spending hours there. I've traveled back several times since, most recently this past spring. The day was cold but clear: tourists and Londoners stopped to watch the skaters. Weaving（穿梭）among the kids who rushed by on their boards, I found my way to the beam. Then a rail—thin teenager, in a baggy white T—shirt, skidded（滑）up to the beam. He sat next to me. He seemed not to notice the man next to him. But soon I caught a few of his glances. “I was a local here 20 years ago,” I told him. Then, slowly, he began to nod his head. “Safe, man. Safe.”“Yeah,” I said. “Safe.”8. What can we learn about the author soon after he moved to London?A. He felt disappointed.\tB. He gave up his hobby.C. He liked the weather there.\tD.

This question has greatly interested humankind for centuries.Let's state clearly: Einstein was a genius. His face is almost the international symbol for genius. But we want to go beyond one man and explore the nature of genius itself. Why is it that some people are so much more intelligent or creative than the rest of us? And who are they? In the sciences and arts, those praised as geniuses were most often white men, of European origin. Perhaps this is not a surprise. It's said that history is written by the victors, and those victors set the standards for admission to the genius club. When contributions were made by geniuses outside the club—women, or people of a different color or belief—they were unacknowledged and rejected by others.A study recently published by Science found that as young as age six, girls are less likely than boys to say that members of their gender(性别)are “really, really smart.” Even worse, the study found that girls act on that belief: Around age six they start to avoid activities said to be for children who are “really, really smart.” Can our planet afford to have any great thinkers become discouraged and give up? It doesn't take a genius to know the answer: absolutely not.Here's the good news. In a wired world with constant global communication, we're all positioned to see flashes of genius wherever they appear. And the more we look, the more we will see that social factors(因素)like gender, race, and class do not determine the appearance of genius. As a writer says, future geniuses come from those with “intelligence, creativity, perseverance(毅力), and simple good fortune, who are able to change the world.”12. What does the author think of victors' standards for joining the genius club?A. They're unfair.\tB. They're conservative.C. They're objective.\tD. They're strict.13. What can we infer about girls from the study in Science?A. They think themselves smart.B. They look up to great thinkers.C. They see gender differences earlier than boys.D. They are likely to be influenced by social beliefs14 Why are more geniuses known to the public?A. Improved global communication.B. Less discrimination against women.C.

Y.—Dorothy Woodruff and Rosamond Underwood—traveled to a settlement in the Rocky Mountains to teach in a one-room schoolhouse. The girls had gone to Smith College. They wore expensive clothes. So for them to move to Elkhead, Colo. to instruct the children whose shoes were held together with string was a surprise. Their stay in Elkhead is the subject of Nothing Daunted: The Unexpected Education of Two Society Girls in the West by Dorothy Wickenden, who is a magazine editor and Dorothy Woodruff’s granddaughter. Why did they go then? Well, they wanted to do something useful. Soon, however, they realized what they had undertaken.They moved in with a local family, the Harrisons, and, like them, had little privacy, rare baths, and a blanket of snow on their quilt when they woke up in the morning. Some mornings, Rosamond and Dorothy would arrive at the schoolhouse to find the children weeping from the cold. In spring, the snow was replaced by mud over ice. In Wickenden’s book, she expanded on the history of the West and also on feminism, which of course influenced the girls’ decision to go to Elkhead. A hair-raising section concerns the building of the railroads, which entailed (牵涉) drilling through the Rockies, often in blinding snowstorms. The book ends with Rosamond and Dorothy’s return to Auburn.Wickenden is a very good storyteller. The sweep of the land and the stoicism (坚忍) of the people move her to some beautiful writing. Here is a picture of Dorothy Woodruff, on her horse, looking down from a hill top: “When the sun slipped behind the mountains, it shed a rosy glow all around them. Then a full moon rose. The snow was marked only by small animals: foxes, coyotes, mice, and varying hares, which turned white in the winter.” 4. Why did Dorothy and Rosamond go to the Rocky Mountains?A.

First announced in April, 2016, the tax which applies to soft drinks containing more than 5g of sugar per 100ml, was introduced to help reduce childhood obesity（肥胖）. It is believed that today's children and teenagers are consuming three times the recommended level of sugar, putting them at a higher risk of the disease. Initially the sugar tax was expected to make £520m a year for the Treasury. However, data of the first six months showed it would make less than half this amount. At present it is expected to generate £240m for the year ending in April 2019, which will go to school sports. It comes after more than half of soft drinks sold in shops have had their sugar levels cut by manufacturers（制造商）so they can avoid paying the tax. Drinks now contain 45 million fewer kilos of sugar as a result of manufacturers' efforts to avoid the charge, according to Treasury figures. Since April drinks companies have been forced to pay between 18p and 24p for every litre of sugary drink they produce or import, depending on the sugar content. However, some high sugar brands, like Classic Coca Cola, have accepted the sugar tax and are refusing to change for fear of upsetting consumers. Fruit juices, milk-based drinks and most alcoholic drinks are free of the tax, as are small companies manufacturing fewer than 1m litres per year. Today's figures, according to one government official, show the positive influence the sugar tax is having by raising millions of pounds for sports facilities（设施）and healthier eating in schools. Helping the next generation to have a healthy and active childhood is of great importance, and the industry is playing its part. 12. Why was the sugar tax introduced?A. To collect money for schools.\tB. To improve the quality of drinks.C. To protect children’s health.\tD. To encourage research in education.13. How did some drinks companies respond to the sugar tax?A. They turned to overseas markets.\tB. They raised the prices of their products.C. They cut down on their production.\tD.

Fruit juices, milk-based drinks and most alcoholic drinks are free of the tax, as are small companies manufacturing fewer than 1m litres per year.（然而，一些高糖品牌，如经典可口可乐，已经接受了糖税，并拒绝改变，因为担心会惹恼消费者。果汁、以牛奶为原料的饮料和大多数酒精饮料是免税的，每年生产不到100万升的小公司也是免税的。）”可知，糖税主要来自经典可口可乐这些高糖品牌。故选D项。【15题详解】推理判断题。根据文章最后一段中“Today’s figures, according to one government official, show the positive influence the sugar tax is having by raising millions of pounds for sports facilities and healthier eating in schools.（根据一位政府官员的说法，今天的数据显示了糖税的积极影响，它为学校的体育设施和健康饮食筹集了数百万英镑）”可推断，糖税政策的实施是一个成功的政策。故选B项。第二节", "modality": "t", "image_urls": [], "inference": "{\n\"type\":\"概念题\",\n\"analysis\":[\n\t[\"The sugar tax was introduced to protect children’s health (C)\"],\n\t[\"Some drinks companies responded to the sugar tax by reducing their products’ sugar content (D)\"],\n\t[\"The sugar tax is collected from drinks, but fruit juices, milk-based drinks, most alcoholic drinks, and small companies manufacturing fewer than 1m litres per year are free of the tax (A, B, C are incorrect)\"],\n\t[\"The adoption of the sugar tax policy can be inferred as a success story (B)\"]\n],\n\"answer\":\"C, D, A, B\"\n}", "rating": "{\"is_correct\": false, \"correctness_score\": 0, \"completeness_score\": 3, \"innovation_score\": 2, \"reasoning_score\": 3, \"student_level\": \"高中\"}"}

The clear front of the box had a “keyhole” in a geometric shape, and the birds were given five differently shaped “keys” to choose from. Inserting the correct “key” would let out the nut.In humans, babies can put a round shape in a round hole from around one year of age, but it will be another year before they are able to do the same with less symmetrical (对称的) shapes. This ability to recognize that a shape will need to be turned in a specific direction before it will fit is called an “allocentric frame of reference”. In the experiment, Goffin’s cockatoos were able to select the right tool for the job, in most cases, by visual recognition alone. Where trial-and-error was used, the cockatoos did better than monkeys in similar tests. This indicates that Goffin’s cockatoos do indeed possess an allocentric frame of reference when moving objects in space, similar to two-year-old babies.The next step, according to the researchers, is to try and work out whether the cockatoos rely entirely on visual clues (线索), or also use a sense of touch in making their shape selections.4.

And it was in Chile she discovered she could get last-minute cheap deals on ships going to Antarctica from the islands off Tierra del Fuego, the southernmost tip of the South American mainland. “I just decided wanted to go,” she says. “I had no idea about what I’d find there and I wasn’t nervous, I just wanted to do it. And I wanted to do it alone as I always prefer it that way.”In March 2008, Ginni boarded a ship with 48 passengers she’d never met before, to begin the journey towards Antarctica. “From seeing the wildlife to witnessing sunrises, the whole experience was amazing. Antarctica left an impression on me that no other place has,” Ginni says. “I remember the first time I saw a humpback whale; it just rose out of the water like some prehistoric creature and I thought it was smiling at us. You could still hear the operatic sounds it was making underwater.”The realization that this is a precious land, to be respected by humans, was one of the biggest things that hit home to Ginni.8.

The city discovered its harbor. Then, one after another, Sydney discovered lots of things that were just sort of there — broad parks, superb beaches, and a culturally diverse population. But it is the harbor that makes the city.Andrew Reynolds, a cheerful fellow in his early 30s, pilots Sydney ferryboats for a living. I spent the whole morning shuttling back and forth across the harbor. After our third run Andrew shut down the engine, and we went our separate ways — he for a lunch break, I to explore the city.“I’ll miss these old boats,” he said as we parted.“How do you mean?” I asked.“Oh, they’re replacing them with catamarans. Catamarans are faster, but they’re not so elegant, and they’re not fun to pilot. But that’s progress, I guess.”Everywhere in Sydney these days, change and progress are the watchwords (口号), and traditions are increasingly rare. Shirley Fitzgerald, the city’s official historian, told me that in its rush to modernity in the 1970s, Sydney swept aside much of its past, including many of its finest buildings. “Sydney is confused about itself,” she said. “We can’t seem to make up our minds whether we want a modern city or a traditional one. It’s a conflict that we aren’t getting any better at resolving (解决).”On the other hand, being young and old at the same time has its attractions. I considered this when I met a thoughtful young businessman named Anthony. “Many people say that we lack culture in this country,” he told me. “What people forget is that the Italians, when they came to Australia, brought 2000 years of their culture, the Greeks some 3000 years, and the Chinese more still. We’ve got a foundation built on ancient cultures but with a drive and dynamism of a young country. It’s a pretty hard combination to beat.”He is right, but I can’t help wishing they would keep those old ferries.12. What is the first paragraph mainly about?A. Sydney’s striking architecture.\tB. The cultural diversity of Sydney.C. The key to Sydney’s development.\tD. Sydney’s tourist attractions in the 1960s.13. What can we learn about Andrew Reynolds?A. He goes to work by boat.\tB. He looks forward to a new life.C. He pilots catamarans well.\tD. He is attached to the old ferries.14. What does Shirley Fitzgerald think of Sydney?A. It is losing its traditions.\tB. It should speed up its progress.C. It should expand its population.\tD. It is becoming more international.15. Which statement will the author probably agree with?A. A city can be young and old at the same time.B. A city built on ancient cultures is more dynamic.C. modernity is usually achieved at the cost of elegance.D.

The city discovered its harbor. (20世纪60年代初，澳大利亚悉尼发生了一件大事。这座城市发现了它的港口) ”以及“But it is the harbor that makes the city. (但是是港口造就了城市)”可知，本段主要介绍了悉尼发展的关键是港口。故选C项。【13题详解】细节理解题。根据第二段“Andrew Reynolds, a cheerful fellow in his early 30s, pilot Sydney ferryboats for a living. (30岁出头的Andrew Reynolds是个快乐的小伙子，他在悉尼担任渡轮领航员为生)”、第三段“I’ll miss these old boats. (我会想念这些旧船的)”以及第五段“Catamarans are faster, but they’re not so elegant, and they’re not fun to pilot.

And they’ve  never  actually    41   you. Everything  they know  about  you   42   through  this device,  sometimes  from  hundreds  of miles  away.    43   they feel they can know  you   44   from  the sound  of your voice.  That’s  how powerful  the   45   is.  Powerful,  yes, but not always    46  . For years  I dealt  with my travel  agent  only by phone.  Rani,  my faceless  agent  whom  I’d never  met   47  , got me rock-bottom  prices  on airfares,  cars, and hotels.  But her cold voice  really    48   me. I sometimes  wished  to   49   another  agent.  One morning,  I had to   50   an immediate  flight  home  for a family  emergency.  I ran into Rani’s  office    51  . The woman  sitting  at the desk,    52   my madness,  sympathetically  jumped  up. She gave  me a   53   smile,  nodded  while  listening  patiently,  and then printed  out the   54   immediately.  “What  a wonderful  lady!”  I thought.  Rushing  out   55   I called  out over my shoulder,  “By the way,  what’s  your name?”  “I’m  Rani,”  she said. I turned  around  and saw a   56   woman  with a big smile  on her face waving  to wish  me a safe trip. I was   57  ! Why  had I thought    she was cold?  Rani  was, well,  so   58  . Sitting  back  in the car on the way to the airport,  I figured  it all out. Rani’s    59   ― her warm  smile,  her nods,  her ‘I’m here for you’   60   ― were  all silent  signals  that didn’t  travel  through  wires.  41. A. accepted    B. noticed    C. heard     D. met 42.

Thank you for filling in for   56  .” His words freed me from my bad   57  . I thought to myself, how even without an arm he was more of a leader. Damaged but not defeated, he was   58   ahead of me.

I myself  went  through  this  41  process  and found  something  that has changed  my  42  at college  for the better:  I discovered  ASL- --American  Sign Language  (美式手语 ).

Little  did I know  that I would  discover  my  45    for ASL.  The   46    began  during  my first week  at college.  I watched  as the ASL  Club     47    their translation  of a song.  Both  the hand  movements  and the very   48    of communicating  without  speaking    49  me. What  I saw was completely  unlike  anything  I had experienced  in the   50   . This newness  just left me   51   more.  After  that, feeling  the need  to   52   further,  I decided  to drop in on one of ASL  club’s meetings.  I only learned  how to   53   the alphabet  that day. Yet instead  of being  discouraged  by my   54   progress,  I was excited.  I then made  it a point  to   55   those  meetings  and learn  all I could.  The following  term,  I   56   an ASL  class.  The professor  was deaf and any talking  was   57   . I soon  realized  that the silence  was not unpleasant.    58   , if there  had been  any talking,  it would  have    59   us to learn  less.

Freddy  was an average    44  , but not an average  person.  He had the rare balance  of fun and compassion （同情） . He would     45    the loudest  over fun and be the saddest  over anyone’s    46    . Before  the school  year    47    , I gave  the kids a special     48    , T-shirts  with the words  “Verbs  Are Your    49   ” on them.  I had advised  the kids that while  verbs（动词） may seem  dull, most  of the  50    things  they do throughout  their lives  will be verbs.

Just last year,  I was  56  a workshop  when  someone  knocked  at the classroom  door.  A woman   57  the interruption  and handed  me an envelope.  I stopped  teaching  and   58   it up. Inside  were  the “Verbs”  shirt and a   59   from  Freddy’s  mother.  “Freddy  passed  away  on Thanksgiving.  He wanted  you to have  this.”  I told the story  to the class.

的电子邮件．因此可以得知第二个条件是需要拥有加拿大护照（passport）．origin 意为\"起源\"，accent 意为\"口音；重音\"，friend 意为\"朋友\"．均不符合文意．故正确答案为B．43．D 结合前后文，可知  Jordan Axani 和他的女朋友 Elizabeth Gallagher 预定了打折的环球机票，但是他们的关系（relationship）结束了．因此承接上文提到的内容．holiday 意为\"假期\"，marriage 意为\"婚姻\"，dream 意为\"梦；梦想\"．均不符合文意．故正确答案为D．44．A 结合前文可知 Jordan Axani 和他的女朋友分手了，他不想让她的机票浪费（go to waste）．come to mind 意为\"想到\"，go

结合文意，由于预定（booking）的时候护照的信息没有要求．结合上下文可知预定机票的政策是只需提供姓名和护照．apply 意为\"申请\"，check 意为\"检查，核对\"，bargain 意为\"交易，契约\"．均不符合题意．故正确答案为B．47．A 结合句意，任何一个加拿大 Elizabeth Gallagher 都可以使用（use）它．it 指代的环球机票．borrow 意为\"借\"，choose 意为\"选择\"，buy 意为\"买\"．均不符合题意．故正确答案为A．48．C 结合句意，\"我\"只是想看到这机票有一个好的用处，让某人体验（experience）很多快乐．sacrifice 意为\"牺牲\"，express 意为\"表达\"，provide 意为\"提供\"．均不符合文意．故正确答案为C．49．C 结合后文，他贴出了他的提议（offer）在一个社交网络的网站上，并且受到了数以千计的电子邮件…．answer 意为\"答案\"，advice 意为\"建议\"，comment 意为\"评论\"．均不符合文意．故正确答案为C．50．B 结合句意，并且收到了数以千计的电子邮件，包括来自 30 名带着正确（right）护照的 Elizabeth Gallagher．same 意为\"相同的\"，根据常识，没有一模一样的护照；now 意为\"现在的\"，real 意为\"真实的\"．均不符合文意．故正确答案为B．51．A 结合后文，更加有趣的是（interesting），有数以百计的加拿大人有兴趣把他们的名字改为 Elizabeth Gallagher．annoying 意为\"烦人的\"，satisfying 意为\"满意的\"，convincing 意为\"有说服力的\"．均不符合文意．故正确答案为A．52．D 结合前后文，更加有趣的是，有数以百计的加拿大人有兴趣把他们的名字改（changing）为 Elizabeth Gallagher．write 意为\"写\"，give 意为\"给予\"，lend 意为\"借出\"．均不符合文意．故正确答案为D．53．D 结合前文中提及的众多人给 Jordan Axani

I  41  the idea of taking  the class  because , after all, who doesn ’t want  to  42  a few dollars?  More  than that, I’d always  wanted  to learn  chess.  And,  even  if I weren’t   43  enough  about  free credits,  news  about  our  44   was appealing  enough  to me. He   was an international  grandmaster,  which   45  I would  be learning  from  one of the game ’s   46  . I could  hardly  wait to 47  him. Maurice  Ashley  was kind and smart,  a former  graduate  returning  to teach,  and this  48  was no game  for him: he meant  business.  In his introduction,  he made  it  49  that our credits  would  be hard-earned.  In order  to   50  the class,  among  other  criteria,  we had to write  a paper  on how we plan to 51 what  we would  learn  in class  to our future  professions  and,   52  , to our lives.  I managed  to get an A in that   53  and learned  life lessons  that have  served  me well beyond  the  54  . Ten years  after my chess  class  with Ashley,  I’m still putting  to use what  he 55 me: “The  absolute  most  important   56  that you learn  when  you play chess  is how to make  good   57  . On every  single  move  you have  to  58  a situation,  process  what  your opponent  (对手 ) is doing  and 59   the best move  from  among  all your options.”  These  words  still ring true today  in my   60  as a journalist.  41.

The instructors  called  for an ambulance.    55  , after a brief  stay in hospital,  Ben was well enough  to be allowed  to   56   and later the family  met up for dinner.  We chatted  about  everything  and then Ben   57   to me. “I just want  to say thank  you,”  he said. “You    58   my life!”  I still can’t  believe  what  a   59   it was.
