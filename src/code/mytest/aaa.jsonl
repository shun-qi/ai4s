But other  ways,  like talking  to someone  you trust,  can lead you to solving  your problem  or at least feeling  better.  Try taking  these  four steps.  the next time you are stressed:  (1) Get support.  When  you need  help,  reach  out to the people  who care about  you. Talk to a trusted  adult,  such as a parent  or other  relatives.    72    They  might  have  had similar  problems,  such as dealing  with a test, or the death  of a beloved  pet. (2) Don\u2019t take it out on yourself.  Sometimes  when  kids are stressed  and upset  they take it out on themselves.  Oh, dear,  that\u2019s not a good  idea.  Remember  that there    are always  people  to help you. Don\u2019t take it out on yourself.    73    (3) Try to solve  the problem.  After  you\u2019re calm  and you have  support  from  adults  and friends,  it\u2019s time to get down  to business.    74    Even  if you can\u2019t solve  it all, you can solve  a piece  of it. (4) Be positive.  Most  stress  is temporary  (\u6682\u65f6\u7684 ). Remember  stress  does go away,  especially  when  you figure  out the problem  and start working  on solving  it.  These  steps  aren\u2019t magic,  but they do work.  And if you can stay positive  as you you\u2019re  your way through  a tough  time,  you\u2019ll help yourself  feel better  even  faster.    75    A. Ask for a helping  hand  to get you through  the tough  situation.  B. Notice  your friends \u2019 feelings  and find a way to help them.  C. Different  people  feel stress  in different  ways.  D. Ah, it feels  so good  when  the stress  is gone.  E. You need  to figure  out what  the problem  is. F. And don\u2019t forget  about  your friends.  G. Then,  find a way to calm  down.", "instruct": "\n###\u8eab\u4efd###\n\n\t\u4f60\u662f\u4e00\u540d\u53c2\u52a0\u9ad8\u8003\u7684\u8003\u751f\uff0c\u62e5\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u529b\u3002\n\n###\u79d1\u76ee###\n\n\u82f1\u8bed\n\n###\u6307\u4ee4###\n\n\t\u4f60\u5c06\u5bf9\u4ee5\u4e0b\u9898\u76ee\u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u7b54\uff0c\u5728\u9605\u8bfb\u9898\u76ee\u540e\uff0c\u4f60\u4f1a\u6839\u636e\u95ee\u9898\u5224\u65ad\u6240\u5c5e\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u6982\u5ff5\u9898\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u9898\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9898\uff0c\u516c\u5f0f\u5e94\u7528\u9898\uff09\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u4f5c\u7b54\n\n###\u6311\u6218###\n\n\u5982\u679c\u53ef\u4ee5\uff0c\u8bf7\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u4e00\u9898\u591a\u89e3\n\n### \u8f93\u51fa\u683c\u5f0f###\n\n{\n\n\t\"type\":\"\u9898\u76ee\u6240\u5c5e\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\",\n\t\"analysis\":[[\"\u89e3\u6cd5\u4e00\"],[\"\u89e3\u6cd5\u4e8c\"],......]],\n\t#\u5199\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u591a\u7684\u5199\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6211\u9650\u5b9a\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u89e3\u6cd5\n\t#\u5982\u679c\u89e3\u6cd5\u6709\u591a\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u63091\uff0c2\uff0c3\uff0c4\u8fd9\u6837\u5206\u70b9\u5206\u6790\n\t#\u6bcf\u4e00\u4e2a[]\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e00\u79cd\u89e3\u6cd5\n\t\"answer\":\u201c\u4f60\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u201d\n\n}\n\n***\u6ce8\u610f\uff0c\u4ec5\u4ec5\u6309***\\### \u8f93\u51fa\u683c\u5f0f###\u91cc\u7684\u683c\u5f0f\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4e0d\u8981\u8f93\u51fa\u5176\u5b83\u5185\u5bb9\n\n", "golden_label": "CFAED", "analysis": "71\uff0eC \u6839\u636e\u4e0b\u6587\u7684 Some  ways  of dealing  with stress  \u548cBut other  ways\u53ef\u77e5\uff0c\u4e0a\u6587\u662f\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4eba\u4f1a\u4ee5\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u611f\u53d7\u538b\u529b\uff0e \u6545\u9009 C72\uff0eF \u6839\u636e\u4e0b\u6587\u7684  After  you\u2019re calm  and you have  support  from  adults  and friends\u53ef\u77e5\uff0c\u4e0a\u6587\u662f\u5e76\u4e14\u4e0d\u8981\u5fd8\u4e86\u4f60\u7684\u670b\u53cb\u4eec\uff0c \u6545\u9009 F\uff0e73\uff0eA \u6839\u636e\u4e0a\u6587\u7684 Remember  that there  are always  people  to help you\u53ef\u77e5\uff0c\u610f\u601d\u4e3a\u5bfb\u6c42\u5e2e\u52a9\uff0c\u4f7f\u4f60\u5ea6\u8fc7\u8270\u96be\u5904\u5883\uff0c \u6545\u9009 A\uff0e74\uff0eE \u6839\u636e\u4e0a\u6587\u7684 it\u2019s time to get down  to business\u53ef\u77e5\uff0c\u610f\u601d\u4e3a\u8be5\u505a\u6b63\u4e8b\u4e86\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u5f04\u6e05\u695a\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff0c \u6545\u9009 E\uff0e75\uff0eD \u6839\u636e\u6574\u7bc7\u77ed\u6587\u53ef\u77e5\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u5e94\u8be5\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5f53\u538b\u529b\u79bb\u5f00\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u4f60\u4f1a\u611f\u89c9\u5982\u6b64\u7684\u597d\u554a\uff0c\u6545\u9009 D\uff0e", "modality": "t", "image_urls": [], "llllll": "\u6211\u51c6\u5907\u597d\u4e86\u54c8\u54c8\u54c8\u54c8\u54c8\u54c8\u54c8\u54c8\u54c8\u54c8\u54c8"}

Nothing  can hurt confidence  more  than being  told that you aren\u2019t doing  well.      72      , so good  public  speaking  training  should  develop  those  instead  of telling  you what  you shouldn \u2019t do. \u00b7    73      If you find a public  speaking  course  that looks  as though  it\u2019s going  to give you lots of dos and don\u2019ts, walk away!

Your  audience  can be your friends . \u00b7You  are a special  person  not a clone  Most  importantly,  good  public  speaking  training  should  treat you as a special  one, with your own personal  habits.      75   . Your  training  course  should  help you bring  out your personality,  not try to turn you into someone  you\u2019re not. A. You aren\u2019t like anybody  else B. You already  do lots of things  well C. Turn  your back  on too many  rules  D. Check  the rules  about  dos and don\u2019ts E. Whatever  the presentation,  public  speaking  is tough  F.

So today  I want  to give you some  wisdom  about  how to make  the most  of the time you spend  in the kitchen . Here  are three  tips for great  cooking  on a tight schedule : \u2460Think  ahead . The moments  when  I think  cooking  is a pain are when  I\u2019m already  hungry  and there  is nothing  ready  to eat. So think  about  of the coming  week . When  will you have  time to cook ? Do you have  the right  materials  ready ? \u3000 37  \u3000 \u2461Make  your time worth  it. When  you do find time to cook  a meal , make  the most  of it and save yourself  time later on. Are you making  one loaf of bread ? \u3000 38  \u3000 it takes  around  the same  amount  of time to make  more  of something . So save yourself  the effort  for a future  meal . \u2462\u3000 39  \u3000 This may surprise  you, but one of the best tools  for making  cooking  worth  your time is experimentation . It gives  you the chance  to hit upon  new ideas  and recipes  that can work  well with your appetite  and schedule . The more  you learn  and the more  you try, the more  ability  you have  to take control  of your food and your schedule . Hopefully  that gives  you a good  start. \u3000 40  \u3000 and don\u2019t let a busy  schedule  discourage  you from  making  some  great  changes  in the way you eat and live!   A. Try new things  B. Ability  is easily  improved  C. Make  three  or four instead  D. Understand  your food better  E. Cooking  is a burden  for many  people  F. Let cooking  and living  simply  be a joy rather  than a burden  G. A little time planning  ahead  can save a lot of work  later on", "instruct": "\n###\u8eab\u4efd###\n\n\t\u4f60\u662f\u4e00\u540d\u53c2\u52a0\u9ad8\u8003\u7684\u8003\u751f\uff0c\u62e5\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u529b\u3002\n\n###\u79d1\u76ee###\n\n\u82f1\u8bed\n\n###\u6307\u4ee4###\n\n\t\u4f60\u5c06\u5bf9\u4ee5\u4e0b\u9898\u76ee\u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u7b54\uff0c\u5728\u9605\u8bfb\u9898\u76ee\u540e\uff0c\u4f60\u4f1a\u6839\u636e\u95ee\u9898\u5224\u65ad\u6240\u5c5e\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u6982\u5ff5\u9898\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u9898\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9898\uff0c\u516c\u5f0f\u5e94\u7528\u9898\uff09\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u4f5c\u7b54\n\n###\u6311\u6218###\n\n\u5982\u679c\u53ef\u4ee5\uff0c\u8bf7\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u4e00\u9898\u591a\u89e3\n\n### \u8f93\u51fa\u683c\u5f0f###\n\n{\n\n\t\"type\":\"\u9898\u76ee\u6240\u5c5e\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\",\n\t\"analysis\":[[\"\u89e3\u6cd5\u4e00\"],[\"\u89e3\u6cd5\u4e8c\"],......]],\n\t#\u5199\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u591a\u7684\u5199\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6211\u9650\u5b9a\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u89e3\u6cd5\n\t#\u5982\u679c\u89e3\u6cd5\u6709\u591a\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u63091\uff0c2\uff0c3\uff0c4\u8fd9\u6837\u5206\u70b9\u5206\u6790\n\t#\u6bcf\u4e00\u4e2a[]\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e00\u79cd\u89e3\u6cd5\n\t\"answer\":\u201c\u4f60\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u201d\n\n}\n\n***\u6ce8\u610f\uff0c\u4ec5\u4ec5\u6309***\\### \u8f93\u51fa\u683c\u5f0f###\u91cc\u7684\u683c\u5f0f\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4e0d\u8981\u8f93\u51fa\u5176\u5b83\u5185\u5bb9\n\n", "golden_label": "BGCAF", "analysis": "36\uff0eB \u6839\u636e\u7b2c\u4e00\u6bb5\u4e2d\u7a7a\u683c\u524d \"ability , money  and time\"\u53ca\u7a7a\u683c\u540e\u53e5\u5b50 \"Money  is a topic  I\u2019ll save for another  day.

Banks,  companies,  and government  agencies  use secret  codes  in doing  business,  especially  when  information  is sent by computer.  People  have  used secret  codes  for thousands  of years.     36    Code  breaking  never  lags (\u843d\u540e ) far behind  code  making.  The science  of creating  and reading  coded  messages  is called  cryptography.  There  are three  main  types  of cryptography.     37    For example,  the first letters  of \u201cMy elephant  eats too many  eels\u201d  spell out the hidden  message  \u201cMeet  me.\u201d     38    You might  represent  each letter  with a number,  for example.  Let\u2019s  number  the letters  of the alphabet,  in order,  from  1 to 26. If we substitute  a number  for each letter,  the message  \u201cMeet  me\u201d would  read \u201c13 5 5 20 13 5.\u201d A code  uses symbols  to replace  words,  phrases,  or sentences.  To read the message  of a real code,  you must  have  a code  book.     39    For example,  \u201cbridge\u201d  might  stand  for \u201cmeet\u201d  and \u201cout\u201d  might  stand  for \u201cme.\u201d  The message    \u201cBridge  out\u201d would  actually  mean  \u201cMeet  me.\u201d     40    However,  it is also hard to keep  a code  book  secret  for long.  So codes  must  be changed  frequently.  A. It is very hard to break  a code  without  the code  book.  B. In any language,  some  letters  are used more  than others.  C. Only  people  who know  the keyword  can read the message.  D. As long as there  have  been  codes,  people  have  tried to break  them.  E. You can hide a message  by having  the first letters  of each word  spell  it out. F. With  a code  book,  you might  write  down  words  that would  stand  for other  words.  G. Another  way to hide a message  is to use symbols  to stand  for specific  letters  of the alphabet.", "instruct": "\n###\u8eab\u4efd###\n\n\t\u4f60\u662f\u4e00\u540d\u53c2\u52a0\u9ad8\u8003\u7684\u8003\u751f\uff0c\u62e5\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u529b\u3002\n\n###\u79d1\u76ee###\n\n\u82f1\u8bed\n\n###\u6307\u4ee4###\n\n\t\u4f60\u5c06\u5bf9\u4ee5\u4e0b\u9898\u76ee\u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u7b54\uff0c\u5728\u9605\u8bfb\u9898\u76ee\u540e\uff0c\u4f60\u4f1a\u6839\u636e\u95ee\u9898\u5224\u65ad\u6240\u5c5e\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u6982\u5ff5\u9898\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u9898\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9898\uff0c\u516c\u5f0f\u5e94\u7528\u9898\uff09\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u4f5c\u7b54\n\n###\u6311\u6218###\n\n\u5982\u679c\u53ef\u4ee5\uff0c\u8bf7\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u4e00\u9898\u591a\u89e3\n\n### \u8f93\u51fa\u683c\u5f0f###\n\n{\n\n\t\"type\":\"\u9898\u76ee\u6240\u5c5e\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\",\n\t\"analysis\":[[\"\u89e3\u6cd5\u4e00\"],[\"\u89e3\u6cd5\u4e8c\"],......]],\n\t#\u5199\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u591a\u7684\u5199\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6211\u9650\u5b9a\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u89e3\u6cd5\n\t#\u5982\u679c\u89e3\u6cd5\u6709\u591a\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u63091\uff0c2\uff0c3\uff0c4\u8fd9\u6837\u5206\u70b9\u5206\u6790\n\t#\u6bcf\u4e00\u4e2a[]\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e00\u79cd\u89e3\u6cd5\n\t\"answer\":\u201c\u4f60\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u201d\n\n}\n\n***\u6ce8\u610f\uff0c\u4ec5\u4ec5\u6309***\\### \u8f93\u51fa\u683c\u5f0f###\u91cc\u7684\u683c\u5f0f\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4e0d\u8981\u8f93\u51fa\u5176\u5b83\u5185\u5bb9\n\n", "golden_label": "DEGFA", "analysis": "36\uff0eD\u672c\u9898\u8003\u5bdf\u662f\u903b\u8f91\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u4e0b\u4e00\u53e5 \"code  breaking  never  lags behind  code  making\"\u53ef\u77e5\u4e0a\u4e00\u53e5\u662f\u53ea\u8981\u51fa\u73b0\u5bc6\u7801\uff0c\u5c31\u4f1a\u6709\u4eba\u53bb\u89e3\u7801\uff0c \u9009\u9879 D\u4e2d\u7684 break\u4e0e\u7a7a\u683c\u540e\u9762\u53e5\u4e2d\u7684 breaking\u6784\u6210\u4e00\u79cd\u590d\u73b0\uff1b \u6545\u9009 D\uff0e37\uff0eE \u672c\u9898\u8003\u5bdf\u662f\u53e5\u5b50\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4f8b\u8bc1\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ece\u540e\u9762\u6587\u7ae0\u7684\u4e3e\u4f8b\u4e2d \"For example , the first letters  are \u2018My elephant  eats too many  eels\u2019 spell  out the hidden  message  \u2018Meet  me.\u2019\"\u90a3\u4e48\u524d\u4e00\u53e5\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u5bf9\u4f8b\u5b50\u7684\u6982\u62ec\uff0c\u5373\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u77e5\u9053\u662f\u8fd0\u7528\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5355\u8bcd\u7684\u9996\u5b57\u6bcd\u6765\u7ec4\u6210\u5bc6\u7801\uff0c E\u9009\u9879\u6b63\u786e38\uff0eG \u672c\u9898\u8003\u5bdf\u662f\u6587\u7ae0\u7684\u7bc7\u7ae0\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u524d\u4e00\u6bb5\u662f\u8bb2\u5230\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u7bc7\u7ae0\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e0b\u4e00\u6bb5\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u8bb2\u8ff0\u7b2c\u4e8c\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5bc6\u7801\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5 \uff0c\u800c\u6839\u636e\u8be5\u6bb5\u7684\u4f8b\u5b50 \uff0c\u5373\u5b57\u6bcd\u8868\u4e2d\u5b57\u6bcd\u6392\u5217\u987a\u5e8f\u8f6c\u5316\u6210\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c \u6240\u4ee5\u8fd9\u91cc\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u662f another  way \u8fd8\u6709 alphabet\uff0c\u6545\u9009 G\uff0e39\uff0eF \u672c\u9898\u8003\u5bdf\u7684\u662f\u903b\u8f91\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ece\u4e0a\u4e00\u53e5 \"To read the message  of a real code , you must  have  a code  book\"\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u501f\u7528\u89e3\u7801\u4e66\u6765\u627e\u51fa\u5bc6\u7801\u5355\u8bcd\u6240\u5bf9\u5e94\u771f\u6b63\u610f\u601d\uff0c F\u9009\u9879\u8868\u793a\u4f60\u5e94\u8be5\u627e\u51fa\u89e3\u7801\u4e66\u4e2d\u5bc6\u7801\u6240\u4ee3\u8868\u7684\u8bcd\u8bed\uff0c \u6545F\u6b63\u786e\uff0e40\uff0eA \u672c\u9898\u8003\u5bdf\u7684\u662f\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u4ee5\u53ca\u8f6c\u6298\u5173\u7cfb \uff0c\u6839\u636e\u4e0b\u4e00\u53e5\u51fa\u73b0 \"it is also hard to keep  a code  book  secret  for long,\"\u8fd9\u91cc\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86 also hard\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u4e0a\u4e00\u53e5\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u4e3a hard\uff1b\u53e6\u5916however\u8868\u793a\u8f6c\u6298\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e0a\u4e00\u53e5\u4e0e\u4e0b\u4e00\u53e5\u8868\u8fbe\u76f8\u5bf9\u5e94\uff1b \u6545\u9009 A\uff0e", "modality": "t", "image_urls": [], "llllll": "\u6211\u51c6\u5907\u597d\u4e86\u54c8\u54c8\u54c8\u54c8\u54c8\u54c8\u54c8\u54c8\u54c8\u54c8\u54c8"}

But it doesn\u2019t  happen  by accident.  It starts  with looking  inside  yourself  and understanding  who you are with respect  to the natural  world  and how you approach  the gardening  process.  \u25cf   37    Some  people  may think  that a garden  is no more  than plants,  flowers,  patterns  and masses  of color.  Others  are concerned  about  using  gardening  methods  that require  less water  and fewer  fertilizers  (\u80a5\u6599 ).    38   . However,  there  are a number  of other  reasons  that might  explain  why you want  to garden.  One of them  comes  from  our earliest  years.  \u25cfRecall(\u56de\u5fc6 ) your childhood  memories  Our model  of what  a garden  should  be often  goes back  to childhood.

If you\u2019d  like to build  a powerful  bond  with your garden,  start by taking  some  time to recall  the gardens  of your youth.     40   . Then  go outside  and work  out a plan to translate    your childhood  memories  into your grown-up  garden.  Have  fun. A. Know  why you garden  B. Find a good  place  for your own garden  C.

Buying, storing, and cooking fish isn\u2019t difficult.    37    This text is about how to buy and cook fish in an easy way.   38    Fresh fish should smell sweet: you should feel that you\u2019re standing at the ocean\u2019s edge. Any fishy or strong smell means the fish isn\u2019t fresh.    39    When you have bought a fish and arrive home, you\u2019d better store the fish in the refrigerator if you don\u2019t cook it immediately, but fresh fish should be stored in your fridge for only a day or two.

I would  have  laughed  heartily.  Campers,  in my eyes,  were  people  who enjoyed  insect  bites,  ill-cooked  meals,  and uncomfortable  sleeping  bags.  They  had nothing  in common  with me.     36    . The friends  who introduced  me to camping  thought  that it meant  to be a pioneer.     37    We sleep  in a tent, cooked  over an open  fire, and walked  a long distance  to take the shower  and use the bathroom.  This brief  visit with Mother  Nature  cost me two days off from  work,  recovering  from  a bad case of sunburn  and the doctor\u2019s  bill for my son\u2019s  food poisoning.  I was, nevertheless,  talked  into going  on another  fun-filled  holiday  in the wilderness.    38    Instead,  we had a pop-up  camper  with comfortable  beds and an air conditioner.  My nature-loving  friends  had remembered  to bring  all the necessities  of life.    39    We have  done  a lot of it since.  Recently,  we bought  a twenty-eight-foot  travel  trailer  complete  with a bathroom  and a built-in  TV set. There  is a separate  bedroom,  a modern  kitchen  with a refrigerator.  The trailer  even  has matching  carpet  and curtains.     40     It must  be true that sooner  or later,  everyone  finds  his or her way back  to nature.  I recommend  that you find your way in style.  A. This time there  was no tent. B. Things  are going  to be improved.  C. The trip they took me on was a rough  one. D.

Tell the person  you\u2019re  sorry  and explain  that you have  a million  things  to do and then ask if the two of you can talk at a different  time.

If someone  knocks  and it\u2019s not an important  matter , excuse  yourself  and let the person  know  you\u2019re  busy  so they can get the hint (\u6697\u793a ) than when  the door is closed,  you\u2019re  not to be disturbed.  A. If you\u2019re  busy,  don\u2019t  feel bad about  saying  no B. When  you want  to avoid  interruptions  at work  C. Set boundaries  for yourselfas  your time goes D. If you\u2019re  in the other  person\u2019s  office  or in a public  area   E. It\u2019s important  that you let them  know  when  you\u2019ll  be available  F.

Do you want to get up in time to have breakfast with your family, get in some exercise, or just be better prepared for your day? Once you are clear about your reason, tell your family or roommates about the change you want to make.Rethink mornings.

With  such busy  lives,  it can be hard to try and find the time to work  out.   36   Working  out in the morning  provides  additional  benefits  beyond  being  physically  fit. \u25cf Your  productivity  is improved.

There  are a lot of benefits  to working  out, especially  in the mornings.  Set your alarm  clock  an hour early  and push  yourself  to work  out! You will feel energized  all day long.  A. You will stick  to your diet. B. Your  quality  of sleep  improves.  C. You prefer  healthy  food to fast food.  D. There  is no reason  you should  exercise  in the morning.  E.

So the main thing is just to show up and be adventurous, trying different foods and talking to strangers. People love to talk about themselves. If you can start the conversation with a question other than \u201cWhat do you do for a living?\u201d, you\u2019ll be able to get a lot more interesting conversation out of whomever it is you\u2019re talking to. ___37___, it can bring in \u201cI have this old, broken-down vehicle\u201d or \u201cI rode the bus with these crazy people who were laughing at silly jokes in the back.\u201d It just opens up conversation. ___38___? If you can\u2019t take their wine away, you should certainly try to take away their soapbox \uff08\u8bb2\u53f0\uff09. If you\u2019re the host, you can ask them to help you in the kitchen with something and just remove them from the situation.___39___.And what about that other dinner-party killer: awkward silence? If you\u2019re faced with an awkward silence at a dinner party, the only thing that always gets everyone talking again is to give the host a compliment\uff08\u8d5e\u626c\uff09. ___40___. Just quickly turn around and say, \u201cThis cake is extremely delicious and you have to tell me all about it.\u201dSo being interesting at a dinner party isn\u2019t that hard.A. How do you know the hostB. The first step is to go exploringC. If you ask the question \u201cHow did you get here?\u201dD. Be prepared to have awkward conversations with strangersE.

Here are five ways to sustain (\u4fdd\u6301) long-distance friendships. \u00b7Set a regular dateLong-lasting friendships share the characteristic that both sides equally contact (\u8054\u7cfb) and share with one another. With busy schedules, squeezing in phone calls can be a challenge. ___16___. \u00b7More isn\u2019t always merrierMake sure you have communicated with your friend about how frequently each of you wants to be contacted and what method works best for you both. ___17___. There are alternatives to constant written communication, such as leaving voice messages or having a group chat. \u00b7Practise empathy (\u5171\u60c5)___18___. The friend who is remaining needs to be sensitive to all the additional time demands placed on the friend who has moved. The one in the new environment should be sympathetic to the fact that your friend may feel abandoned. \u00b7___19___Anniversaries and birthdays carry even more weight in long-distance friendships. Although technology might make day-to-day communication possible, extra effort goes a long way on special days. Simply keeping a diary that keeps track of friends\u2019 birthdays and other important dates will make sure nothing slips by you. \u00b7Don\u2019t rely on technology alone___20___, but long-distance friendships \u2014 even close ones \u2014 may require more conscious effort to sustain. Try to seek out chances to renew friendships. How to do it? Just spend face-to-face time together whenever possible.A. Remember important datesB. Compensate by writing lettersC. It is also helpful for you to be a friendship keeperD. Try to find a time that works for both of you and stick to itE. Friends need to talk about their preferred methods of communicationF.

The shop  is called  the Dixie  PIT, which  stands  for Power  in Transition .

They  learn  not only how to run a coffee  shop  but also how to deal with their affairs . They  keep  a timecard  and receive  paychecks , which  they keep  in check  registers .

Any owner  will tall you how much  joy a pet brings . For some , an animal  provides  more  comfort  than a husband/wife . A 2002  study  by Karen  Allen  of the State  University  of New  York  measured  stress\uff08\u7d27\u5f20\uff09 levels  and blood  pressure  in people  --- half of them  pet owners  --- while  they performed  5 minutes  of mental  arithmetic \uff08\u7b97\u672f\uff09 or held a hand  in ice water . Subjects  completed  the tasks  alone , with a husband/wife , a close  friend  or with a pet. People  with pets did it best. Those  tested  with their animal  friends  had smaller  change  in blood  pressure  and returned  most  quickly  to baseline  heart  rates .

It seems  people  feel more  relaxed\uff08\u653e\u677e\uff09 around  pets, says Allen , who thinks  it may be because  pets don\u2019t judge . A study  reported  last fall suggests  that having  a pet dog not only raises  your spirits  but may also have  an effect  on your eating  habits . Researchers  at Northwestern  Memorial  Hospital  spent  a year studying  36 fat people  and their equally  fat dogs  on diet-and-exercise  programs ; a separate  group  of 56 people  without  pets were  put on a diet program . On average , people  lost about  I1 pounds , or 5% of their body  weight . Their  dogs  did even  better , losing  an average  of 12 pounds , more  than 15% of their body  weight . Dog owners  didn\u2019t lose any more  weight  than those  without  dogs  but, say researchers , got more  exercise  overall  --- mostly  with their dogs  --- and found  it worth  doing . 67.

Charily  they knew  at what  time the train passed  their homes  and they made  it their business  to stand  along  the railway , wave  to complete  strangers  and cheer  them  up as they rushed  towards  Penang . Often  whole  families  stood  outside  their homes  and waved  and smiled  as if those  on the trains  were  their favorite  relatives . This is the simple  village  people  of Malaysia . I was moved . I had always  traveled  to Malaysia  by plane  or car, so this was the first time I was on a train. I did not particularly  relish  the long train journey  and had brought  along  a dozen  magazines  to read and reread . I looked  about  the train. There  was not one familiar  face. I sighed  and sat down  to read my Economics . It was not long before  the train was across  the Causeway  and in Malaysia . Johore  Baru  was just another  city like Singapore , so I was tired of looking  at the crowds  of people  as they hurried  past. As we went  beyond  the city, I watched  the straight  rows  of rubber  trees  and miles  and miles  of green . Then  the first village  came  into sight , Immediately  I came  alive ; I decided  to wave  hack . From  then on my journey  became  interesting . I threw  my magazines  into the waste  basket  and decided  to join in Malaysian  life. Then  everything  came  alive . The mountains  seemed  to speak  to me. Even  the trees  were  smiling . I stared  at everything  as if I was looking  at it for the first time. The day passed  fast and I even  forgot  to have  my lunch  until I felt hungry . I looked  at my watch  and was surprised  that it was 3:00 pm. Soon  the train pulled  up at   Butterworth . I looked  at the people  all around  me. They  all looked  beautiful . When  my uncle  arrived  with a smile , I threw  my arms  around  him to give him a warm  hug \uff08 \u62e5 \u62b1 \uff09 . I had never  done  this before . He seemed  surprised  and then his weather -beaten  face warmed  up with a huge  smile . We walked  arm in arm to his car. I looked  forward  to the return  journey . 71.

Never  mind  that Beijing \u2019s dry weather  seldom  produces  snow . It is cold enough  in winter  for snow  --- making  machines  to make  a covering  for the hills north  to the capital . And the rapid  growth  of a pleasure  --- seeking  middle  class  has formed  the basis  for this new craze\uff08\u70ed\u6f6e\uff09 .  Since  Beijing \u2019s first ski resort  was opened  ten years  ago, the sport  has enjoyed  astonishing  increase . There  are now more  than a dozen  resorts . Clothes  markets  in the city have  added  bright  colored  ski suits to their winter  collections . Mr. Wei, a manager  of a newly -opened  ski resort  in Beijing , sees the growth  of an industry  that could  soon  lead Chinese  to head  for the ski resorts  of Europe . In recent  years  ski resorts  offering  natural  snow  have  opened  in China . But many  are in faraway  areas  of the country  and can\u2019t really  match  the equipment  and services  of some  ski resorts  in Europe .  Beijing \u2019s skiing  craze  is partly  a result  of the recent  increase  in private\uff08\u79c1\u6709\u7684\uff09 cars. This has led to the growth  of a leisure  industry  in the capital \u2019s suburbs\uff08\u90ca\u533a\uff09, which  until the late-1990s  were  unreachable  to ordinary  people . According  to Mr.  Wei, about  40% of the visitors  to his resort  come  in their own cars. The rest are bused  in by schools , businesses  or government  offices .  The problem  is making  money . Starting  ski resorts  requires  quite  a lot of money ;  hiring  land from  the local  government , preparing  the hills, buying  snow  machines , making  sure there  are enough  water  and electricity  to run them , and buying  ski equipment  for hiring  out to customers .  The ski resort  where  Mr. Wei works  cost nearly  $4m to set up. And as so often  in China  when  someone  comes  up with a good  idea, many  others  hash in and price  wars  break  out. Beijing  now offers  some  of the cheapest  ski training  classes  in the world , though  with most  people  rather  new to the sport , expecting  a few more  doing  the same    job.  50.

All we assume\uff08\u63a8\u6d4b\uff09 is that some  early  men invented  certain  sounds , in one way or another , to express  thoughts  and feelings , actions  and things , so that they could  talk with each other . Later  they agreed  upon  certain  signs , called  letters , which  could  be put together  to show  those  sounds , and which  could  be written  down . Those  sounds , whether  spoken  or written  in letters , are called  words .  The power  of words , then, lies in their associations ---the things  they bring  up to our minds . Words  become  filled  with meaning  for us by experience ; and the longer  we tire, the more  certain  words  bring  back  to us the happy  and sad events  of our past; and the more  we read and learn , the more  the number  of words  that mean  something  to us increases .  Great  writers  are those  who not only have  great  thoughts  but also express  these  thoughts  in words  which  have  powerful  effects  on our minds  and feelings . This clever  use of words  is what  we call literary  style\uff08\u6587\u4f53\uff09 . Above  all, the real poet is a master  of words . He can express  his meaning  in words  which  sing like music , and which  by their position  and association  can move  men to tears . We should  therefore  learn  to choose  our words  carefully  and use them  correctly , or they will make  our speech  silly and common .  58.

An animal  that is aware\uff08\u610f\u8bc6\uff09of itself  has a high level  of intelligence .   Awareness  can be tested  by studying  whether  the animal  recognizes  itself  in the mirror , that is, its own reflected  image\uff08\u53cd\u5c04\u51fa\u7684\u5f71\u50cf\uff09 . Many  animals  fail this exercise  bitterly , paying  very little attention  to the reflected  image . Only  humans , and some  intelligent  animals  like apes and dolphins , have  shown  to recognize  that the image  in the mirror  is of themselves . Now  another  animal  has joined  the club. In the Proceedings  of the National  Academy  of Sciences , researchers  report  that an Asian  elephant  has passed  the mirror  self-reflection  test. \u201cWe thought  that elephants  were  the next important  animal ,\u201d said Dinana  Reiss  of the Wildlife  Conservation  Society , an author  of the study  with Joshua  M. Plotnik  and Fans  B.M. de Waal  of Emory  University . With  their large  brains , Reiss  said, elephants  \u201cseemed  like cousins  to apes and dolphins .\u201d The researchers  tested  Happy , Maxine  and Patty , three  elephants  at the Bronx  Zoo. They  put an 8-foot-square  mirror  on a wall of the animals \u2019 play area\uff08out of the sight  of zoo visitors\uff09and recorded  what  happened  with cameras , including  one built in the mirror . The elephants  used their long noses  to find what  was behind  it, and to examine  parts  of their bodies . Of the three , Happy  then passed  the test, in which  a clear  mark  was painted  on one side of her face. She could  tell the mark  was there  by looking  in the mirror , and she used the mirror  to touch  the mark  with her long nose. Diana  Reiss  said, \u201cWe knew  elephants  were  intelligent , but now we can talk about  their intelligence  in a better  way.\u201d 45.

I received  a letter  from  the head  of the Personnel  Department  that started , \u201cDear  John , I am quite  pleased  that you have  decided  to join us.\u201d That \u201cquite \u201d saddened  me. I thought  he was saying  \u201cwe\u2019re kind of pleased  you decided  to join us although  I wish  we had hired  someone  else.\u201d Then  I discovered  that in American  English  \u201cquite \u201d sometimes  means  \u201cvery\u201d, while  in British  English  it means  \u201cfairly \u201d. So the first lesson  about  working  in other  countries  is to learn  the language  and by that I don\u2019t just mean  the words  people  speak . It is body  language , dress , manners , ideas  and so on. The way people  do things  highlights  many  of the differences  we see between  cultures\uff08\u6587\u5316\uff09 . Some  of these  differences  may be only on the surface  --- dress , food and hours  of work  --- while  others  may be deeper  and take longer  to deal with. Mostly , it is just a question  of getting  used to the differences  and accepting  them , like the climate\uff08\u6c14\u5019\uff09, while  getting  on with business . Some  of the differences  may be an improvement . People  are more  polite ; the   service  is better ; you ask for something  to be done  and it happens  without  having  to ask again . However , other  differences  can be troubling , like punctuality \uff08\u51c6\u65f6\uff09 . If you invite  people  to a party  at 7 o\u2019clock  your guests  will consider  it polite  to turn up exactly  on time in Germany , five minutes  early  in the American  Midwest , an hour early  in Japan , 15 minutes  afterwards  in the UK, up to an hour afterwards  in Italy and some  time in the evening  in Greece . I prefer  not to use the word  \u201clate\u201d because  there  is nothing  wrong  with the times  people  arrive . It is simply  the accepted  thing  to do in their own country . 52. The author  was unhappy  as mentioned  in Paragraph  1 because  he thought  \u3000   . A. the American  bank  didn\u2019t think  much  of him B. the American  bank  might  hire another  person  C. it\u2019s difficult  to get used to American  culture  D. it\u2019s easy to misunderstand  Americans  53.

His name  was Mr. Basille.  He wore  a white  cap and drove  a white  truck.  As a 5-year-old  boy, I couldn\u2019t  take my eyes off the coin changer  fixed  to his belt. He noticed  this one day during  a delivery  and gave  me a quarter  out of his coin changer.  Of course,  he delivered  more  than milk.  There  was cheese,  eggs and so on. If we needed  to change  our order,  my mother  would  pen a note- --\u201cPlease  add a bottle  of buttermilk  next delivery\u201d- --and place  it in the box along  with the empty  bottles.  And then,  the buttermilk  would  magically  appear.  All of this was about  more  than convenience.  There  existed  a close  relationship  between  families  and their milkmen.  Mr. Basille  even  had a key to out house,  for those  times  when  it was so cold outside  that we put the box indoors,  so that the milk wouldn\u2019t  freeze.  And I remember  Mr. Basille  from  time to time taking  a break  at our kitchen  table,  having  a cup of tea and telling  stories  about  his delivery.  There  is sadly  no home  milk delivery  today.  Big companies  allowed  the production  of cheaper  milk,  thus making  it difficult  for milkmen  to compete.  Besides,  milk is for sale everywhere,  and it may just not have  been  practical  to have  a delivery  service.  Recently,  an old milk box in the countryside  I saw brought  back  my childhood  memories.  I took it home  and planted  it on the back  porch(\u95e8\u5eca ). Every  so often  my son\u2019s  friends  will ask what  it is. So I start telling  stories  of my boyhood,  and of the milkman  who brought  us friendship  along  with his milk.  56. Mr. Basille  gave  the boy a quarter  out of his coin changer  _______.  A. to show  his magical  power       B. to pay for the delivery       C. to satisfy  his curiosity           D. to please  his mother  57. What  can be inferred  from  the fact that the milkman  had the key to the boy\u2019s  house?  A. He wanted  to have  tea there.            B. He was a respectable  person.  C. He was treated  as a family  member.      D. He was fully  trusted  by the family.  58. Why  does home  milk delivery  no longer  exist?  A. Nobody  wants  to be a milkman  now.     B. It has been  driven  out of the market.  C. Its service  is getting  poor.              D. It is forbidden  by law. 59. Why  did the author  bring  back  home  an old milk box?  A. He missed  the good  old days.            B. He wanted  to tell interesting  stories.  C. He missed  it for his milk bottles.         D. He planted  flowers  in it.", "instruct": "\n###\u8eab\u4efd###\n\n\t\u4f60\u662f\u4e00\u540d\u53c2\u52a0\u9ad8\u8003\u7684\u8003\u751f\uff0c\u62e5\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u529b\u3002\n\n###\u79d1\u76ee###\n\n\u82f1\u8bed\n\n###\u6307\u4ee4###\n\n\t\u4f60\u5c06\u5bf9\u4ee5\u4e0b\u9898\u76ee\u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u7b54\uff0c\u5728\u9605\u8bfb\u9898\u76ee\u540e\uff0c\u4f60\u4f1a\u6839\u636e\u95ee\u9898\u5224\u65ad\u6240\u5c5e\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u6982\u5ff5\u9898\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u9898\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9898\uff0c\u516c\u5f0f\u5e94\u7528\u9898\uff09\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u4f5c\u7b54\n\n###\u6311\u6218###\n\n\u5982\u679c\u53ef\u4ee5\uff0c\u8bf7\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u4e00\u9898\u591a\u89e3\n\n### \u8f93\u51fa\u683c\u5f0f###\n\n{\n\n\t\"type\":\"\u9898\u76ee\u6240\u5c5e\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\",\n\t\"analysis\":[[\"\u89e3\u6cd5\u4e00\"],[\"\u89e3\u6cd5\u4e8c\"],......]],\n\t#\u5199\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u591a\u7684\u5199\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6211\u9650\u5b9a\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u89e3\u6cd5\n\t#\u5982\u679c\u89e3\u6cd5\u6709\u591a\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u63091\uff0c2\uff0c3\uff0c4\u8fd9\u6837\u5206\u70b9\u5206\u6790\n\t#\u6bcf\u4e00\u4e2a[]\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e00\u79cd\u89e3\u6cd5\n\t\"answer\":\u201c\u4f60\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u201d\n\n}\n\n***\u6ce8\u610f\uff0c\u4ec5\u4ec5\u6309***\\### \u8f93\u51fa\u683c\u5f0f###\u91cc\u7684\u683c\u5f0f\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4e0d\u8981\u8f93\u51fa\u5176\u5b83\u5185\u5bb9\n\n", "golden_label": "CDBA", "analysis": "56\uff0eC \u7ec6\u8282\u63a8\u7406\u9898  \u6839\u636e\u7b2c\u4e00\u6bb5\u4e2d \"I couldn't  take my eyes off\u2026during  a delivery .\"\u7531\u4e8e\u4e00\u5929\u5728\u9001\u8d27\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u4ed6\u6ce8\u610f\u5230 \uff1a\u6211\u76ee\u4e0d\u8f6c\u775b\u5730\u770b\u7740\u56fa\u5b9a\u5728\u4ed6\u76ae\u5e26\u4e0a\u7684\u627e\u96f6\u7684\u786c\u5e01\u5939\uff0e\u53ef\u77e5\uff0c\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u4ed6\u770b\u5230\u4e86\u6211\u7684\u597d\u5947\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c \u5c31\u62ff\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u679a 25\u5206\u7684\u786c\u5e01\u9001\u7ed9\u6211\uff0e\u6545\u9009 C\uff0e57\uff0eD \u7ec6\u8282\u63a8\u7406\u9898  \u672c\u9898\u5bb9\u6613\u9519\u9009 C \u4ed6\u88ab\u5f53\u505a\u5bb6\u5ead\u6210\u5458\u6765\u5bf9\u5f85\uff0c\u5355\u4ece\u5c06\u5bb6\u91cc\u94a5\u5319\u7559\u7ed9\u9001\u5976\u5de5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0d\u80fd\u4f53\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\uff0e\u6839\u636e\u7b2c\u4e09\u6bb5\u7684\u4e2d\u5fc3\u53e5 \"There  existed  a close  relationship  between  families  and their milkmen .\"\uff08\u6bcf\u4e00\u5bb6\u4e0e\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u9001\u5976\u5de5\u90fd\u4fdd\u6301\u7740\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5173\u7cfb \uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u5c06\u5bb6\u91cc\u94a5\u5319\u7559\u7ed9\u9001\u5976\u5de5\u53ef\u63a8\u77e5 \uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e4b\u95f4\u6709\u7740\u826f\u597d\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6545\u9009 D\uff0e58\uff0eB \u7ec6\u8282\u63a8\u7406\u9898  \u6839\u636e\u7b2c\u56db\u6bb5\u63d0\u5230\u7684\u4e24\u70b9\uff1a\u4e00\u3001 \"Big companies  allowed  the production  of cheaper  milk.\"\u5927\u516c\u53f8\u5141\u8bb8\u751f\u4ea7\u66f4\u4fbf\u5b9c\u7684\u725b\u5976\uff0e\u4e8c\u3001 \"milk  is for sale everywhere\" \u725b\u5976\u5230\u5904\u90fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e70\u5230\uff0e\u6240\u4ee5\u9001\u5976\u4e1a\u5c31\u4e0d\u518d\u666f\u6c14\uff0c\u5931\u53bb\u4e86\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u610f\u4e49 \uff0e\u6545\u9009 B\uff0e59\uff0eA \u7ec6\u8282\u63a8\u7406\u9898  \u672c\u9898\u8003\u67e5\u4e86\u4f5c\u8005\u5c06\u725b\u5976\u7bb1\u5e26\u56de\u5bb6\u7684\u539f\u56e0 \uff0e\u6839\u636e\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u6bb5 \"an old milk box in the countryside  I saw brought  back  my childhood  memories\" \u6211\u5728\u4e61\u4e0b\u770b\u89c1\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e7\u725b\u5976\u7bb1\u52fe\u8d77\u4e86\u6211\u7ae5\u5e74\u7684\u56de\u5fc6 \uff0e\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u63d0\u5230\u7ecf\u5e38\u7ed9\u513f\u5b50\u7684\u670b\u53cb\u8bb2\u8fc7\u53bb\u9001\u5976\u5de5\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\uff0c\u53ef\u89c1\u4ed6\u5bf9\u8fc7\u53bb\u7684\u6000\u5ff5\uff0c \u6545\u9009 A\uff0e", "modality": "t", "image_urls": [], "llllll": "\u6211\u51c6\u5907\u597d\u4e86\u54c8\u54c8\u54c8\u54c8\u54c8\u54c8\u54c8\u54c8\u54c8\u54c8\u54c8"}

The Tall Persons  Club  Great  Britain  (TPCGB),  which  was formed  six months  ago to campaign  for the needs  of the tall, has turned  its attention  to hotels  and restaurants.  Beds  that are too small,  shower  heads  that are too low, and restaurant  tables  with hardly  any leg-room  all make  life difficult  for those  of above  average    height,  it says.  But it is not just the extra-tall  whose  needs  are not being  met. The average  night  of the population  has been  increasing  ye the standard  size of beds,  doorways,  and chairs  has remained  unchanged.  \u201cThe  bedding  industry  says a bed should  be six inches  larger  than the person  using  it, so even  a king-size  bed at 6\u20326\u2033(6  feet and 6 inches)  is falling  short  for 25% of men,  while  the standard  6\u20323\u2033 bed caters  for less than half of the male  population.\u201d  said TPCGB  president  Phil Heinricy,  \u201cseven-foot  beds would  work  fine.\u201d  Similarly,  restaurant  tables  can cause  no end of problems.  Small  tables,  which  mean  the long-legged  have  to sit a foot or so away  from  them,  are enough  to make  tall customers  go elsewhere.  Some  have  already  taken  note,  however.  At Queens  Moat  Houses\u2032  Caledonian  Hotel  in Edinburgh,  6\u20326\u2033beds  are now put in as standard  after requests  for longer  beds from  taller  visitors,  particularly  Americans.  64. What  is the purpose  of the TPCGB  campaign?  A. To provide  better  services.             B. To rebuild  hotels  and restaurants.  C. To draw  public  attention  to the needs  of the tall.   D. To attract  more  people  to become  its members.  65. Which  of the following  might  be a bed of proper  length  according  to Phil Heinricy?

They  may start businesses  elsewhere.  C. They  have  to find easy chairs  to match  the tables.   D. They  have  to provide  enough  space  for the long-legged.  67. What  change  has already  been  made  in a hotel  in Edinburgh?  A. Tall people  pay more  for larger  beds.      B. 6\u20326\u2033beds  have  taken  the place  of 6\u20323\u2033beds.    C.

So this year she did something  more  than a hobby:  She planted  vegetables  in her yard.  For her fist garden,  Ms Feeley  has put in 15 tomato  plants,  and five rows  of a variety  of vegetables.  The family\u2019s  old farm  house  has become  a chicken  house,  its residents  arriving  next month.  Last year,  Ms. Rita Gartin  kept a small  garden.  This year she has made  it much  larger  because,  she said, \u201cThe  cost of everything  is going  up and I was looking  to lose a few pounds  too; so it\u2019s a win-win  situation  all around.\u201d  They  are among  the growing  number  of Americans  who,  driven  by higher  living  costs  and a falling  economy  (\u7ecf\u6d4e ), have  taken  up vegetable  gardening  for the first time.  Others  have  increased  the size of their existing  gardens.  Seed  companies  and garden  shops  say no since  the 1970s  have  there  been  such an increase  in interest  in growing  food at home.  Now  many  gardens  across  the country  have  been  sold out for several  months.  In Austin,  Tex, some  of the gardens  have  a three-year  waiting  list. George  C. Ball Jr, owner  of a company,  said sales  of vegetable  seeds  and plants  are up by 40%,  over last year,  double  the average  growth  of last five years.  Mr. Ball argues  that some  of the reasons  have  been  building  for the last few years.  The big one is striking  use in me cost on food like bread  and milk,  together  with the increases  in the price  of fruit and vegetables.  Food  prices  have  increase  of higher  oil price.  People  are driving  less, taking  fewer  vacations,  so there  more  time to garden.  68. What  does the word  \u201cresidents\u201d  in Paragraph  1 probably  refer  to?

A. she is happier  and her garden  bigger  B. she may spend  less and lose weight  C. she is selling  more  and buying  less D. she has grown  more  varieties  of vegetables    70. Why  is vegetable  gardening  becoming  increasingly  popular?  A. More  Americans  are dong  it for fun.  B. The price  of oil is lower  than before.  C. There\u2019s  a growing  need  for fruits.

Most  people,  and many  animals,  like eating  it. However,  the only way for them  to get that honey  is to find a wild bees\u2019 nest and take the honey  from  it. Often,  these  nests  are high up in trees,  and it is difficult  to find them.  In parts  of Africa,  though,  people  and animals  looking  for honey  have  a strange  and unexpected  helper  --- a little bird called  a honey  guide.  The honey  guide  does not actually  like honey,  but it does like the wax in the beehives  (\u8702\u623f ). The little bird cannot  reach  this wax,  which  is deep  inside  the bees\u2019 nest. So, when  it finds  a suitable  nest, it looks  for someone  to help it. The honey  guide  gives  a loud cry that attracts  the attention  of both passing  animals  and people.  Once  it has their attention,  it flies through  the forest,  waiting  from  time to time for the curious  animal  or person  as it leads  them  to the nest. When  they finally  arrive  at the nest, the follower  reaches  in to get at the delicious  honey  as the bird patiently  waits  and watches.  Some  of the honey,  and the wax,  always  falls to the ground,  and this is when  the honey  guide  takes  its share.  Scientists  do not know  why the honey  guide  likes  eating  the wax,  but it is very determined  in its efforts  to get it. The birds  seem  to be able to smell  wax from  a long distance  away.  They  will quickly  arrive  whenever  a beekeeper  is taking  honey  from  his beehives,  and will even  enter  churches  when  beeswax  candles  are being  lit. 60. Why  is it difficult  to find a wild bees\u2019 nest?  A. It\u2019s small  in size.        B. It\u2019s hidden  in trees.  C. It\u2019s covered  with wax.     D. It\u2019s hard to recognize.  61.

Although  our \u201cact\u201d would  last only for a short  time,  we could  see quite  a number  of interesting  things.  We all stood  at the far end of the studio  as workmen  prepared  the scene,  setting  up trees  at the edge  of a winding  path.  Very  soon,  bright  lights  were  turned  on and the big movie-camera  was wheeled  into position.  The director  shouted  something  to the camera  operator  and then went  to speak  to the two famous  actors  nearby.  Since  it was hot in the studio,  it came  as a surprise  to us to see one of the actors  put on a heavy  overcoat  and start walking  along  the path.  A big fan began  blowing  tiny white  feathers  down  on him, and soon  the trees  were  covered  in \u201csnow \u201d. Two more  fans were  turned  on, and a \u201cstrong  wind \u201d blew  through  the trees.  The picture  looked  so real that it made  us feel cold.  The next scene  was a complete  contrast  (\u5bf9\u6bd4 ). The way it was filmed  was quite  unusual.  Pictures  taken  on an island  in the Pacific  were  shown  on a glass  screen.  An actor  and actress  stood  in front  of the scene  so that they looked  as if they were  at the water \u2019s edge  on an island.  By a simple  trick like this, palm  trees,  sandy  beaches,  and blue,  clear  skies  had been  brought  into the studio!  Since  it was our turn next,  we were  left wondering  what  scene  would  be prepared  for us. For a full three  minutes  in our lives  we would  be experiencing  the excitement  of being  film \u201cStars \u201d! 64. Who  is the author?  A. A cameraman.                B. A film director.    C. A crowd-scene  actor.          D. A workman  for scene  setting.  65. What  made  the author  feel cold?  A. The heavy  snowfall.          B. The man-made  scene.  C. The low temperature.

A man who has not had a chance  to go swimming  for years  can still swim  as well as ever when  he gets back  in the water.  He can get on a bicycle  after many  years  and still ride away.  He can play catch  and hit a ball as well as his son. A mother  who has not thought  about  the words  for years  can teach  her daughter  the poem  that begins  \u201cTwinkle,  twinkle,  little star\u201d or remember  the story  of Cinderella  or Goldilocks  and the Three  Bears.  One explanation  is the law of overlearning , which  can be stated  as follows:  Once  we have  learned  something,  additional  learning  trials  increase  the length  of time we will remember  it.                                 In childhood  we usually  continue  to practice  such skills  as swimming,  bicycle  riding,  and playing  baseball  long after we have  learned  them.  We continue  to listen  to and remind  ourselves  of words  such as \u201cTwinkle,  twinkle,  little star\u201d and childhood  tales such as Cinderella  and Goldilocks.  We not only learn  but overlearn.  The multiplication  tables  (\u4e58\u6cd5\u53e3\u8bc0\u8868 ) are an exception  to the general  rule that we forget  rather  quickly  the things  that we learn  in school,  because  they are another  of the things  we overlearn  in childhood.  The law of overlearning  explains  why cramming  (\u7a81\u51fb\u5b66\u4e60 ) for an examination,  though  it may result  in a passing  grade,  is not a satisfactory  way to learn  a college  course.  By cramming,  a student  may learn  the subject  well enough  to get by on the examination,  but he is likely  soon  to forget  almost  everything  he learned.  A little   overlearning,  on the other  hand,  is really  necessary  for one\u2019s future  development.  67. What  is the main  idea of Paragraph  1? A. People  remember  well what  they learned  in childhood.  B. Children  have  a better  memory  than grown-ups.  C. Poem  reading  is a good  way to learn  words.  D. Stories  for children  are easy to remember.  68. The author  explains  the law of overlearning  by _______.  A. presenting  research  findings    B. setting  down  general  rules  C. making  a comparison         D. using  examples  69. According  to the author,  being  able to use multiplication  tables  is _______.  A. a result  of overlearning             B. a special  case of cramming  C. a skill to deal with math  problems    D. a basic  step towards  advanced  studies  70. What  is the author \u2019s opinion  on cramming?  A. It leads  to failure  in college  exams.     B. It\u2019s helpful  only in a limited  way.  C. It\u2019s possible  to result  in poor memory.

They  don\u2019t listen  because  they already  know  it all. I was lucky:  I became  a pilot in 1970,  almost  ten years  before  I graduated  from  medical  school.  I didn\u2019t realize  then,  but becoming  a pilot makes  me a better  surgeon.  I loved  flying.  As I flew bigger,  faster  planes,  and in worse  weather.  I learned  about  crew  resource  management  (\u673a\u7ec4\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406 ), or CRM,  a new idea to make  flying  safer.  It means  that crew  members  should  listen  and speak  up for a good  result,  regardless  of positions.  I first read about  CRM  in 1980.  Not long after that, an attending  doctor  and I were  flying  in bad weather.  The controller  had us turn too late to get our landing  ready.  The attending  doctor  was flying;  I was safety  pilot He was so busy  because  of the bad turn, he had forgotten  to put the landing  gear (\u8d77\u843d\u67b6 ) down.  He was a better  pilot --- and my boss --- so it felt unusual  to speak  up. But I had to: Our lives  were  in danger.  I put aside  my uneasiness  and said, \u201cWe need  to put the landing  gear down  now! \u201d That was my first real lesson  in the power  of CRM,  and I\u2019ve used it in the operating  room  ever since.  CRM  requires  that the pilot/surgeon  encourage  others  to speak  up. It further  requires  that when  opinions  are from  the opposite,  the doctor  doesn \u2019t overreact,  which  might  prevent  fellow  doctors  from  voicing  opinions  again.  So when  I\u2019m in the operating  room,  I ask for ideas  and help from  others.  Sometimes  they\u2019re not willing  to speak  up. But I hope  that if I continue  to encourage  them,  someday  someone  will keep  me from  \u201clanding  gear up\u201d. 56. What  dose the author  say about  doctors  in general?  A. They  like flying  by themselves.     B. They  are unwilling  to take advice.  C. They  pretend  to be good  pilots.     D. They  are quick  learners  of CRM.  57. The author  deepened  his understanding  of the power  of CRM  when_______.    A. he saved  the plane  by speaking  up    B. he was in charge  of a flying  task C. his boss landed  the plane  too late     D. his boss operated  on a patient  58. In the last paragraph  \u201clanding  gear up\u201d probably  means  ______.

The idea was to reunite  Europe  after the Second  World  War.  At the same  time,  the \u201cFringe\u201d  appeared  as a challenge  to the official  festival.  Eight  theatre  groups  turned  up uninvited  in 1947,  in the belief  that everyone  should  have  the right  to perform,  and they did so in a public  house  disused  for years.  Soon,  groups  of studentsfirstly  from  Edinburgh  University,  and later from  the universities  of Oxford  and Cambridge,  Durham  and Birmingham  were  making  the journey  to the Scottish  capital  each summer  to perform  theatre  by little-known  writers  of plays  in small  church  halls  to the people  of Edinburgh.  Today  the \u201cFringe\u201d,  once  less recognized,  has far outgrown  the festival  with around  1,500  performances  of theatre,  music  and dance  on every  one of the 21 days it lasts.  And yetas  early  as 1959,  with only 19 theatre  groups  performing,  some  said it was getting  too big. A paid administrator  was first employed  only in 1971,  and today  there  are eight  administrators  working  all year round  and the number  rises to 150 during  August  itself.  In 2004  there  were  200 places  housing  1,695  shows  by over 600 different  groups  from  50 different  countries.  More  than 1,25 million  tickets  were  sold.    60. Point  was the purpose  of Edinburgh  Festival  at he beginning?  A. To bring  Europe  together  again.  B. To honor  heroes  of World  War 11. C. To introduce  young  theatre  groups.  D. To attract  great  artists  from  Europe.  61. Why  did some  uninvited  theatre  groups  come  to Edinburgh  in 1947?  A. They  owned  a public  house  there.  B. They  came  to take up a challenge.  C. They  thought  they were  also famous.  D. They  wanted  to take part in the festival.  62. Who  joined  the \u201cFringe \u201d after it appeared?  A. Popular  writers.      B. University  students.  C. Artists  from  around  the world.   D. Performers  of music  and dance.  63. We may learn  from  the text that Edinburgh  Festival________.

Looking  like a setting  from  the film Charlie  & the Chocolate  Factory , Singapore \u2019s Chocolate  Research  Facility  (CRF)  has over 100 varieties  of chocolates.  Its founder  is Chris  Lee who grew  up at his parents \u2019 corner  store  with one hand  almost  always  in the jar of sweets.  If the CRF  seems  to be a smart  idea,  that\u2019s because  Lee is not merely  a seasoned  salesperson  but also head  of a marketing  department  that has business  relations  with big names  such as Levi\u2019s and Sony.  That idea surely  results  in the imagination  at work  when  it comes  to making  different  flavored  (\u5473\u9053 ) chocolates.  The CRF \u2019s produce  is \u201cgreen \u201d, made  within  the country  and divided  into 10 lines,  with the Alcohol  Series  being  the most  popular.  The Exotic  Series  --- with   Sichuan  pepper,  red bean  (\u8c46), cheese  and other  flavors  --- also does well and is fun to taste.  And for chocolate  snobs , who think  that they have  a better  knowledge  of chocolate  than others,  the Connoisseur  Series  uses cocoa  beans  from  Togo,  Cuba,  Venezuela  , and Ghana,  among  others.  64. What  is good  about  chocolate?  A. It serves  as a suitable  gift.          B. It works  as an effective  medicine.  C. It helps  improve  the state of mind.    D. It strengthens  business  relations.  65. Why  is Chris  Lee able to develop  his idea of the CRF?  A. He knows  the importance  of research.  B. He learns  form  shops  of similar  types.  C.

And I am one of them.  Take  my family\u2019s  last vacation.  It was my six-year-old  son\u2019s  winter  break  form  school,  and we were  heading  home  form  Fort Lauderdale  after a weeklong  trip. The flight  was overbooked,  and Delta,  the airline,  offered  us $400  per person  in credits  to give up our seats  and leave  the next day. I had meeting  in New  York , So I had to get back.  But that didn\u2019t mean  my husband  and my son couldn \u2019t stay. I took my nine-month-old  and took off for home.  The next day my husband  and son were  offered  more  credits  to take an even  later flight.  Yes, I encouraged  --- okay,  ordered-them  to wait it out at the airport,  to \u201cearn\u201d more  Delta  Dollars.  Our total take:  $1,600.  Not bad, huh? Now  some  people  may think  I\u2019m a bad mother  and not such a great  wife either.  But as a big-time  bargain  hunter,  I know  the value  of a dollar.  And these  days,  a good  deal is something  few of us can afford  to pass up. I\u2019ve made  living  looking  for the best deals  and exposing  (\u63ed\u9732 ) the worst  tricks.  I have  been  the consumer  reporter  of NBC \u2019s Today  show  for over a decade.  I have  written  a couple  of books  including  one titled  Tricks  of the Trade:  A Consumer  Survival  Guide.  And I really  do what  I believe  in. I tell you this because  there  is no shame  in getting  your money\u2019s  worth.  I\u2019m also tightfisted  when  it comes  to shoes,  clothes  for my children,  and expensive  restaurants.  But I wouldn \u2019t hesitate  to spend  on a good  haircut.  It keeps  its longer,  and it\u2019s the first thing  people  notice.  And I will also spend  on a classic  piece  of furniture.  Quality  lasts.    56. Why  did Delta  give the author \u2019s family  credits?  A. They  took a later flight.         B. They  had early  bookings.  C. Their  flight  had been  delayed.    D. Their  flight  had been  cancelled.  57. What  can we learn  about  the author?  A. She rarely  misses  a good  deal.       B. She seldom  makes  a compromise.  C. She is very strict  with her children .  D. She is interested  in cheap  products.  58. What  does the author  do? A. She\u2019s a teacher.        B. She\u2019s a housewife.  C.

She is quiet  but alert (\u8b66\u89c9 ). Twenty  centimeters  from  her face researchers  have  placed  a white  card with two black  spots  on it. She stares  at it carefully.  A researcher  removes  the card and replaces  it by another,  this time with the spots  differently  spaced.  As the cards  change  from  one to the other,  her gaze (\u51dd\u89c6 ) starts  to lose its focus  --- until a third,  with three  black  spots,  is presented.  Her gaze returns;  she looks  at it for twice  as long as she did at the previous  card.  Can she tell that the number  two is different  from  three,  just 24 hours  after coming  into the world?  Or do newborns  simply  prefer  more  to fewer?  The same  experiment,  but with three  spots  shown  before  two, shows  the same  return  of interest  when  the number  of spots  changes.  Perhaps  it is just the newness?  When  slightly  older  babies  were  shown  cards  with pictures  of objects  (a comb,  a key, an orange  and so on), changing  the number  of objects  had an effect  separate  from  changing  the objects  themselves.  Could  it be the pattern  that two things  make,  as opposed  to three?  No again.  Babies  paid more  attention  to squares  moving  randomly  on a screen  when  their number  changed  from  two to three,  or three  to two. The effect  even  crosses  between  senses.  Babies    who were  repeatedly  shown  two spots  became  more  excited  when  they then heard  three  drumbeats  than when  they heard  just two; likewise  (\u540c \u6837 \u5730 ) when  the researchers  started  with drumbeats  and moved  to spots.  60.

I was telling  someone  how much  I had enjoyed  reading  Barack  Obama\u2019s  Dreams  From  My Father  and how it had changed  my views  of our President.  A friend  I was talking  to agreed  with me that it was, in his words,  \u201ca brilliantly \uff08\u7cbe\u5f69\u5730\uff09 written  book\u201d.  however,  he then went  on to talk abour  Mr. Obama  in a way which  suggested  he had no idea of his background  at all. I sensed  that I was talking  to a book  liar. And it seems  that my friend  is not the only one. Approximately  two thirds  of people  have  lied about  reading  a book  which  they haven\u2019t.  In the World  Book  Day\u2019s  \u201cReport  on Guilty  Secrets\u201d,  Dreams  From  My Father  is at number  9. The report  lists ten books,  and various  authors,  which  people  have  lied about  reading,  and as I\u2019m not one to lie too often  (I\u2019d hate to be caught  out ), I\u2019ll admit  here and now that I haven\u2019t  read the entire  top ten. But I am pleased  to say that, unlike  42 percent  of peoplt,  I have    read the book  at number  one, George  Orwell\u2019s  1984.  I think  it\u2019s really  brilliant.  The World  Book  Day report  also has some  other  interesting  information  in it. It says that many  people  lie about  having  read jane Austen,  Charles  Dickens,  Fyodor  Dostoevsky  (I haven\u2019t  read him, but haven\u2019t  lied about  it either)and  Herman  Melville.  Asked  why they lied, the most  common  reason  was to \u201cimpress\u201d  someone  they were  speaking  to. This coule  be tricky  if the conversation  became  more  in \u2013 depth!  But when  asked  which  authors  they actually  enjoy,  people  named  J.k. Rowling,  John  Grisham,  Sophie  Kinsella  (ah, the big sellers,  in other  words).  Forty-two  percent  of people  asked  admitted  they turned  to the back  of the book  to read the end before  finishing  the story  (I\u2019ll come  clean:  I do this and am astonished  that 58 percent  said they had never  dome  so). 64. How  did the author  find his friend  a book  liar? A. By judging  his manner  of speaking.    B. By looking  into his background.  C. By mentioning  a famous  name.        D. By discussing  the book  it self. 65. Which  of the following  is a \u201cguilty  secret\u201d  according  to the World  Book  Day  report?  A. Charles  Dickens  is very low on the top-ten  list.  B. 42% of people  pretended  to have  read 1984.  C. The author  admitted  having  read 9 books.       D. Dreams  From  My Father  is hardly  read.  66.

Written  accounts  from  the 18th and 19th centuries  described  flocks\uff08\u7fa4\uff09 so large  that they darkened  the sky for hours.  It was calculated  that when  its population  reach  its highest  point,  there  were  more  than 3 billion  passenger  pigeons  \u2013 a number  equal  to 24 to 40 percent  of the total bird population  in the United  States,  making  it perhaps  the most  abundant  birds  in the world.  Even  as late as 1870  when  their numbers  had already  become  smaller,  a flock  believed  to be 1 mile wide  and 320 miles  (about  515 kilometers)  long was seen near Cincinnati.  Sadly,  the abundance  of passenger  pigeons  may have  been  their undoing . Where  the birds  were  abundant,  people  believed  there  was an ever-lasting  supply  and killed  them  by the thousands.  Commercial  hunters  attracted  them  to small  clearings  with grain,  waited  until pigeons  had settled  to feed,  then threw  large  nets over them,  taking  hundreds  at a time.  The birds  were  shipped  to large  cities  and sold in restaurants.  By the closing  decades  of the 19th century,  the hardwood  forests  where  passenger  pigeons  nested  had been  damaged  by Americans\u2019  need  for wood,  which  scattered\uff08\u9a71\u6563\uff09 the flocks  and forced  the birds  to go farther  north,  where  cold temperatures  and spring  storms  contributed  to their decline.  Soon  the great  flocks  were  gone,  never  to be seen again.  In 1897,  the state of Michigan  passed  a law prohibiting  the killing  of passenger  pigeons,  but by then,  no sizable  flocks  had been  seen in the state for 10 years.  The last confirmed  wild pigeon  in the United  States  was shot by a boy in Pike County,  Ohio,  in 1900.  For a time,  a few birds  survived  under  human  care.  The last of them,  known  affectionately  as Martha,  died at the Cincinnati  Zoological  Garden  in September  1, 1914.    24.

The whip  gets all of the attention , but it\u2019s mostly  for show . In reality , it\u2019s the chair  that does the important  work . When  a lion tamer  holds  a chair  in front  of the lion\u2019s face, the lion tries to focus  on all four legs of the chair  at the same  time. With  its focus  divided , the lion becomes  confused  and is unsure  about  what  to do next. When  faced  with so many  options , the lion chooses  to freeze  and wait instead  of attacking  the man holding  the chair .     How  often  do you find yourself  in the same  position  as the lion? How  often  do you have  something  you want  to achieve\uff08e.g. lose weight , start a business , travel  more\uff09--- only to end up confused  by all of the options  in front  of you and never  make  progress ?     This upsets  me to no end because  while  all the experts  are busy  debating  about  which  option  is best, the people  who want  to improve  their lives  are left confused  by all of the conflicting  information . The end result  is that we feel like we can\u2019t focus  or that we\u2019re focused  on the wrong  things , and so we take less action , make  less progress ,   and stay the same  when  we could  be improving .     It doesn \u2019t have  to be that way. Anytime  you find the world  waving  a chair  in your face, remember  this: All you need  to do is focus  on one thing . You just need  to get started . Starting  before  you feel ready  is one of the habits  of successful  people . If you have  somewhere  you want  to go, something  you want  to accomplish , someone  you want  to become  \u2026 take immediate  action . If you\u2019re clear  about  where  you want  to go, the rest of the world  will either  help you get there  or get out of the way. 28. Why  does the lion tamer  use a chair ? \u3000   \u3000 A. To show  off his skills .       B. To trick the lion. C. To get ready  for a fight .      D. To entertain  the audience . 29. In what  sense  are people  similar  to a lion facing  a chair ? \u3000   \u3000 A. They  feel puzzled  over choices .     B. They  hold on to the wrong  things . C.

In fact, half of the 6,000-7,000  languages  spoken  around  the world  today  will likely  die out by the next century,  according  to the United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific,  and Cultural  Organization  (UNESCO).   In an effort  to prevent  language  loss, scholars  from  a number  of organizations- -- UNESCO  and National  Geographic  among  them ---have  for many  years  been  documenting  dying  languages  and the cultures  they reflect.  Mark  Turin,  a scientist  at the Macmillan  Center,  Yale  University,  who specializes  in the languages  and oral traditions  of the Himalayas,  is following  in that   tradition . His recently  published  book,  A Grammar  of Thangmi  with an Ethnolinguistic  Introduction  to the Speakers  and Their  Culture , grows  out of his experience  living,  looking  and raising  a family  in a village  in Nepal.  Documenting  the Tangmi  language  and culture  is just a starting  point  for Turin,  who seeks  to include  other  languages  and oral traditions  across  the Himalayans  reaches  of India,  Nepal,  Bhutan,  and China.  But he is not content  to simply  record  these  voices  before  they disappear  without  record.  At the University  of Cambridge  Turin  discovered  a wealth  of important  materials ---including  photographs,  films,  tap recordings,  and field notes- --which  had remained  unstudied  and were  badly  in need  of care and protection.  Now,  through  the two organizations  that he has founded- --the Digital  Himalaya  Project  and the World  Oral Literature  Project- --Turin  has started  a campaign  to make  such documents,  found  in libraries  and stores  around  the world,  available  not just to scholars  but to the youngers.  Generations  of communities  from  whom  the materials  were  originally  collected.  Thanks  to digital  technology  and the widely  available  Internet.  Turin  notes,  the endangered  languages  can be saved  and reconnected  with speech  communities.  32. Many  scholars  are making  efforts  to\u3000   \u3000.

He was extremely  worried  as the suitcase  had all his important  papers , including  his passport . He reported  the case to the police  and then sat there , lost and lonely  in strange  city, thinking  of the terrible  troubles  of getting  all the paperwork  organized  again  from  a distant  country  while  trying  to settle  down  in a new one.

Her parents  had carefully  sorted  them  out, although  they had found  mainly  foreign  addresses  on most  of the documents . At last they had seen a half-written  letter  in the pile in which  my husband  had given  his new telephone  number  to a friend .

Au Pair in Stamford,  for example,  has got increasing  numbers  of request  for Chinese  au pairs  from  aero to around  4,000  since  2004.  And that\u2019s  true all across  the country.  \u201cI thought  it would  be useful  for him to learn  Chinese  at an early  age\u201d Joseph  Stocke,  the managing  director  of s company,  says of his 2-year -old son. \u201cI would  at least like to give him the chance  to use the language  in the future .\u201d After  only six months  of being  cared  by 25-year-old  woman  from  China,  the boy can already  understand  basic  Chinese  daily  expressions,  his dad says.  Li Drake,  a Chinese  native  raising  two children  in Minnesota  with an American  husband,  had another  reason  for looking  for an au pair from  China.  She didn\u2019t  want  her children  to miss out on their roots.  \u201cBecause  I am Chinese,  my husband  and I   wanted  the children  to keep  exposed  to (\u63a5\u89e6 ) the language  and culture.\u201d  she says.  \u201cStaying  with a native  speaker  is better  for children  than simply  sitting  in a classroom,\u201d  says Suzanne  Flynn,  a professor  in language  education  of Children.  \u201cBut parents  must  understand  that just one year with au pair is unlikely  to produce  wonders.   Complete  mastery  demands  continued  learning  until the age of 10 or 12.\u201d The popularity  if au pairs  from  China  has been  strengthened  by the increasing  numbers  of American  parents  who want  their children  who want  their children  to learn  Chinese.  It is expected  that American  demand  for au pairs  will continue  to rise in the next few years.  29. What  does that term \u201cau pair\u201d in the text mean ? \u3000   \u3000 A.

I left for the land of warmth  and vitamin  C (\u7ef4\u751f\u7d20C), thinking  of beaches  and orange  trees.  When  we touched  down  to blue skies  and warm  air, I sent up a small  prayer  of gratefulness.  Swimming  pools,  wine  tasting,  and pink sunsets  (at normal  evening  hours,  not 4 in the afternoon)  filled  the weekend,  but the best part \u2014 particularly  to my taste,  dulled  by months  of cold \u2014 weather  root vegetables  \u2014 was a 7 a.m. adventure  to the Sarasota  farmers\u2019  market  that proved  to be more  than worth  the early  wake-up  call. The market,  which  was founded  in 1979,  sets up its tents  every  Saturday  from  7 a.m. to 1 p.m.,  rain or shine,  along  North  Lemon  and State  streets.  Baskets  of perfect    red strawberries,  the red-painted  sides  of the Java Dawg  coffee  truck;  and most  of all, the tomatoes:  amazing,  large,  soft and round  red tomatoes.  Disappointed  by many  a broken,  vine-ripened  (\u8513\u4e0a\u6210\u719f\u7684 ) promise,  I\u2019ve refused  to buy winter  tomatoes  for years.  No matter  how attractive  they look in the store,  once  I get them  home  they\u2019re  unfailingly  dry, hard,  and tasteless.  But I homed  in, with uncertainty,  on one particular  table  at the Brown\u2019s  Grove  Farm\u2019s  stand,  full of fresh  and soft tomatoes  the size of my fist. These  were  the real deal \u2014 and at that moment,  I realized  that the best part of Sarasota  in winter  was going  to be eating  things  that back  home  in New  York  I wouldn\u2019t  be experiencing  again  for months.  Delighted  as I was by the tomatoes  in sight,  my happiness  deepened  when  I learned  that Brown\u2019s  Grove  Farm  is one of the suppliers  for Jack Dusty,  a newly  opened  restaurant  at the Sarasota  Ritz Carlton,  where  \u2014 luckily  for me \u2014 I was planning  to have  dinner  that very night.  Without  even  seeing  the menu,  I knew  I\u2019d be ordering  every  tomato  on it. 24. What  did the author  think  of her winter  life in New  York?  A. Exciting.     B. Boring.       C.

The Pompidou  Centre  in Paris  is showing  its respect  and admiration  for the artist  and his   powerful  personality  with an exhibition  bringing  together  over 200 paintings,  sculptures,  drawings  and more.  Among  the works  and masterworks  on exhibition  the visitor  will find the best pieces,  most  importantly  The Persistence  of Memory.  There  is also L\u2019 Enigme  sans Fin from  1938,  works  on paper,  objects,  and projects  for stage  and screen  and selected  parts  from  television  programmes  reflecting  the artist\u2019s  showman  qualities.  The visitor  will enter  the World  of Dali through  an egg and is met with the beginning,  the world  of birth.  The exhibition  follows  a path of time and subject  with the visitor  exiting  through  the brain.  The exhibition  shows  how Dali draws  the viewer  between  two infinities  (\u65e0\u9650 ), \u201cFrom  the infinity  small  to the infinity  large,  contraction  and expansion  coming  in and out of focus:  amazing  Flemish  accuracy  and the showy  Baroque  of old painting  that he used in his museum-theatre  in Figueras, \u201d explains  the Pompidou  Centre.  The fine selection  of the major  works  was done  in close  collaboration  (\u5408\u4f5c ) with the Museo  Nacional  Reina  Sofia  in Madrid,  Spain,  and with contributions  from  other  institutions  like the Salvador  Dali Museum  in St. Petersburg,  Florida.  28.

What  is Dali\u2019s  The Persistence  of Memory  considered  to be? A. One of his masterworks.               B. A successful  screen  adaptation.  C. An artistic  creation  for the stage.      D.

This evening,  as on every    Thursday  night,  psychologist  Maud  Lehanne  is leading  two of France\u2019s  favorite  pastimes,  coffee  drinking  and the \u201ctalking  cure\u201d. Here  they are learning  to get in touch  with their true feelings.  It isn\u2019t always  easy.  The customers  \u2014 some  thirty  Parisians  who pay just under  $2 (plus  drinks)  per session  \u2014 care quick  to intellectualize  (\u9ad8\u8c08\u9614\u8bba ), slow  to open  up and connect.  \u201cYou are forbidden  to say \u2018one feels\u2019  or \u2018people  think\u2019 \u201d Lehanne  told them.  \u201cSay \u2018I think,\u2019  \u2018Think  me\u2019.\u201d  A caf\u00e9 society  where  no intellectualizing  is allowed?  It couldn\u2019t  seem  more  un-French.  But Lehanne\u2019s  psychology  caf\u00e9 is about  more  than knowing  oneself:  It\u2019s trying  to help the city\u2019s  troubled  neighborhood  cafes.  Over  the years,  Parisian  cafes  have  fallen  victim  to changes  in the French  lifestyle  \u2014 longer  working  hours,  a fast food boom  and a younger  generation\u2019s  desire  to spend  more  time at home.  Dozens  of new theme  cafes  appear  to change  the situation.  Cafes  focused  around  psychology,  history,  and engineering  are catching  on, filling  tables  well into the evening.  The city\u2019s  \u201cpsychology  cafes \u201d, which  offer  great  comfort,  are among  the most  popular  places.  Middle-aged  homemakers,  retirees,  and the unemployed  come  to such cafes  to talk about  love,  anger,  and dreams  with a psychologist.  And they come  to Lehanne\u2019s  group  just to learn  to say what  they feel. \u201cThere\u2019s  a strong  need  in Paris  for communication, \u201d says Maurice  Frisch,  a caf\u00e9 La Chope  regular  who works  as a religious  instructor  in a nearby  church.  \u201cPeople  have  few real friends.  And they need  to open  up\u201d. Lehanne  says she\u2019d  like to see psychology  cafes  all over France.  \u201cIf people  had normal  lives,  these  cafes  wouldn\u2019t  exist, \u201d she says.  \u201cIf life weren\u2019t  a battle,  people  wouldn\u2019t  need  a special  place  just to speak. \u201d But then,  it wouldn\u2019t  be France.    32. What  are people  encouraged  to do at the cafe La Chope?   A. Learn  a new subject.    B. Keep  in touch  with friends.   C. Show  off their knowledge.   D. Express  their true feelings.   33. How  are cafes  affected  by French  lifestyle  changes?   A. They  are less frequently  visited.   B. They  stay open  for longer  hours.   C. They  have  bigger  night  crowds.   D.

I was able to buy it a little over a year ago because  I had my relatives  give me money  for my birthday  instead  of a lot of clothes  that wouldn\u2019t  fit. I let a salesclerk  fool me into buying  a discontinued  model.  I realized  this a day late, when  I saw newspaper  advertisements  for the set at seventy-five  dollars  less than I had paid.  The set worked  so beautifully  when  I first got it home  that I would  keep  it on until stations  signed  off for the night.  Fortunately,  I didn\u2019t  got any channels  showing  all-night  movies  or I would  never  have  gotten  to bed. Then  I started  developing  a problem  with the set that involved  static  (\u9759\u7535 ) noise.  For some  reason,  when  certain  shows  switched  into a commercial,  a loud noise  would  sound  for a few seconds.  Gradually,  this noise  began  to appear  during  a show,  and to get rid of it, I had to change  to another  channel  and then change  it back.  Sometimes  this technique  would  not work,  and I had to pick up the set and shake  it to remove  the sound.  I actually  began  to build  up my arm muscles  (\u808c\u8089 ) shaking  my set. When  neither  of these  methods  removed  the static  noise,  I would  sit helplessly  and wait for the noise  to go away.  At last I ended  up hitting  the set with my fist, and it stopped  working  altogether.  My trip to the repair  shop  cost me $62, and the set is working  well now,  but I keep  expecting  more  trouble.  21. Why  did the author  say he was fooled  into buying  the TV set? A. He got an older  model  than he had expected.  B. He couldn\u2019t  return  it when  it was broken.  C. He could  have  bought  it at a lower  price.    D. He failed  to find any movie  shows  on it. 22. Which  of the following  can best replace  the phrase  \u201csigned  off\u201d in Paragraph  1? A. ended  all their programs .       B. provided  fewer  channels . C. changed  to commercials .       D. showed  all-night  movies . 23. How  did the author  finally  get his TV set working  again?  A. By shaking  and hitting  it.

Experts  say the way you design  your home  could  play a role in whether  you pack  on the pounds  or keep  them  off. You can make  your environment  work  for you instead  of against  you. Here  are some  ways  to turn your home  into part of diet plan.  Open  the curtains  and turn up the lights.  Dark  environments  are more  likely  to encourage  overeating,  for people  are often  less self-conscious \uff08\u96be\u4e3a\u60c5\uff09 when  they\u2019re  in poorly  lit places-and  so more  likely  to eat lots of food.  If your home  doesn\u2019t  have  enough  window  light,  get more  lamps  and flood  the place  with brightness.  Mind  the colors.  Research  suggests  warm  colors  fuel our appetites.  In one study,  people  who ate meals  in a blue room  consumed  33 percent  less than those  in a yellow  or red room.  Warm  colors  like yellow  make  food appear  more  appetizing,  while  cold colors  make  us feel less hungry.  So when  it\u2019s time to repaint,  go blue.  Don\u2019t  forget  the clock\u2014or the radio.  People  who eat slowly  tend to consume  about  70 fewer  calories\uff08\u5361\u8def\u91cc\uff09 per meal  than those  who rush through  their meals.  Begin  keeping  track  of the time,  and try to make  dinner  last at least 30 minutes,  And while  you\u2019re  at it, actually  sit down  to eat. If you need  some  help slowing  down,  turn on relaxing  music.  It makes  you less likely  to rush through  a meal.  Downsize  the dishes,  Big serving  bowls  and plates  can easily  make  us fat. We eat about  22 percent  more  when  using  a 12-inch  plate  instead  of a 10-inch  plate.    When  we choose  a large  spoon  over a smaller  one ,total  intake\uff08\u6444\u5165\uff09  jumps  by 14 percent.  And we\u2019ll  pour about  30 percent  more  liquid  into a short,  wide  glass  than a tall, skinny  glass.  25. The text is especially  helpful  for those  who care about_______.

It used to be called  the \u201cyear  off\u201d between  school  and university.  The gap-year  phenomenon  originated  (\u8d77\u6e90 ) with the months  left over to Oxbridge  applicants  between  entrance  exams  in November  and the start of the next academic  year.  This year,  25,310  students  who have  accepted  places  in higher  education  institutions  have  put off their entry  until next year,  according  to statistics  on university  entrance  provided  by University  and College  Admissions  Service  (UCAS).  That is a record  14.7%  increase  in the number  of students  taking  a gap year.  Tony  Higgins  from  UCAS  said that the statistics  are good  news  for everyone  in higher  education.  \u201cStudents  who take a well-planned  year out are more  likely  to be satisfied  with,  and complete,  their chosen  course.  Students  who take a gap year are often  more  mature  and responsible,\u201d  he said.   But not everyone  is happy.  Owain  James,  the president  of the National  Union  of Students  (NUS),  argued  that the increase  is evidence  of student  had ship \u2014 young  people  are being  forced  into earning  money  before  finishing  their education.  \u201cNew  students  are now aware  that they are likely  to leave  university  up to \uffe115,000  in debt.  It is not surprising  that more  and more  students  are taking  a gap year to earn money  to support  their study  for the degree.  NUS  statistics  show  that over 40% of students  are  forced  to work  during  term time and the figure  increases  to 90% during  vacation  periods,\u201d  he said. 29. What  do we learn  about  the gap year from  the text?  A. It is flexible  in length.        B. It is a time for relaxation.  C. It is increasingly  popular.     D. It is required  by universities.  30. According  to Tony  Higgins,  students  taking  a gap year______.

Of the outstanding  ladies  listed  below,  who do you think  was the most  important  woman  of the past 100 years?   Jane  Addams  (1860-1935)  Anyone  who has ever been  helped  by a social  worker  has Jane Addams  to thank.  Addams  helped  the poor and worked  for peace.  She encouraged  a sense  of community  (\u793e\u533a ) by creating  shelters  and promoting  education  and services  for people  in need.  In 1931,  Addams  became  the first American  woman  to win the Nobel  Peace  Prize.   Rachel  Carson  (1907-1964)  If it weren\u2019t  for Rachel  Carson,  the environmental  movement  might  not exist  today.  Her popular  1962  book  Silent  Spring  raised  awareness  of the dangers  of pollution  and the harmful  effects  of chemicals  on humans  and on the world\u2019s  lakes  and oceans.   Sandra  Day O\u2019Connor  (1930-present)  When  Sandra  Day O\u2019Connor  finished  third  in her class  at Stanford  Law School,  in 1952,  she could  not find work  at a law firm because  she was a woman.  She became  an Arizona  state senator  (\u53c2\u8bae\u5458 ) and, in 1981,  the first woman  to join the U.S. Supreme  Court.  O\u2019Connor  gave  the deciding  vote in many  important  cases  during  her 24 years  on the top court.     Rosa  Parks  (1913-2005)  On December  1, 1955,  in Montgomery,  Alabama,  Rasa  Parks  would  not give up her seat on a bus to a passenger.  Her simple  act landed  Parks  in prison.  But it also set off the Montgomery  bus boycott.  It lasted  for more  than a year,  and kicked  off the civil-rights  movement.  \u201cThe  only tired I was, was tired of giving  in,\u201d said Parks.  21. What  is Jane Addams  noted  for in history?  A. Her social  work.            B. Her teaching  skills.  C. Her efforts  to win a prize.     D. Her community  background.  22. What  was the reason  for O\u2019Connor\u2019s  being  rejected  by the law firm?  A. Her lack of proper  training  in law. B. Her little work  experience  in court.  C. The discrimination  against  women.  D. The poor financial  conditions.  23. Who  made  a great  contribution  to the civil-rights  movement  in the U.S.?  A. Jane Addams.      B. Rachel  Carson.  C.

Even  when  her daughter  and son asked  her to move  to San Antonio  to help with their children,  she politely  refused.  Only  after a year of friendly  discussion  did Ms. Garza  finally  say yes. That was four years  ago. Today  all three  generations  regard  the move  as a success,  giving  them  a closer  relationship  than they would  have  had in separate  cities.  No statistics  show  the number  of grandparents  like Garza  who are moving  closer  to adult  children  and grandchildren.  Yet there  is evidence  suggesting  that the trend  is   growing.  Even  President  Obama\u2019s  mother-in-law,  Marian  Robinson,  has agreed  to leave  Chicago  and move  into the White  House  to help care for her granddaughters.  According  to a study  by grandparents.com,  83 percent  of the people  said Mrs. Robinson\u2019s  decision  will influence  grandparents  in the American  family.  Two-thirds  believe  more  families  will follow  the example  of Obama\u2019s  family.  \u201cIn the 1960s  we were  all a little wild and couldn\u2019t  get away  from  home  far enough  or fast enough  to prove  we could  do it on our own,\u201d  says Christine  Crosby,  publisher  of Grand , a magazine  for grandparents.  \u201cWe now realize  how important  family  is and how important  it is to be near them,  especially  when  you\u2019re  raising  children.\u201d  Moving  is not for everyone.  Almost  every  grandparent  wants  to be with his or her grandchildren  and is willing  to make  sacrifices,  but sometimes  it is wiser  to say no and visit frequently  instead.  Having  your grandchildren  far away  is hard,  especially  knowing  your adult  child  is struggling,  but giving  up the life you know  may be harder.  25. Why  was Garza\u2019s  move  a success?  A. It strengthened  her family  ties. B. It improved  her living  conditions.  C. It enabled  her make  more  friends.  D. It helped  her know  more  new places.  26. What  was the reaction  of the public  to Mrs. Robinson\u2019s  decision?  A. 17% expressed  their support  for it. B. Few people  responded  sympathetically.  C. 83% believed  it had a bad influence.  D. The majority  thought  it was a trend.  27. What  did Crosby  say about  people  in the 1960s?  A. They  were  unsure  of themselves.  B. They  were  eager  to raise  more  children.  C. They  wanted  to live away  from  their parents.  D. They  had little respect  for their grandparents.    28. What  does the author  suggest  the grandparents  do in the last paragraph?  A. Make  decisions  in the best interests  of their own.  B. Ask their children  to pay more  visits  to them.  C. Sacrifice  for their struggling  children.  D.

I had one trip last year where  I was caught  by a hurricane  in America.  I picked  up the stem  cells in Providence,  Rhode  Island,  and was meant  to fly to Washington  then back  to London.  But when  I arrived  at the check-in  desk at Providence,  the lady on the desk said:  \u201cWell,  I\u2019m really  sorry,  I\u2019ve got some  bad news  for you \u2014 there  are no flights  from  Washington.\u201d  So I took my box and put it on the desk and I said:  \u201cIn this box are some  stem  cells that are urgently  needed  for a patient  \u2014 please,  please,  you\u2019ve  got to get me back  to the United  Kingdom.\u201d  She just dropped  everything.  She arranged  for a flight  on a small  plane  to be held for me. re-routed  (\u6539\u9053 ) me through  Newark  and got me back  to the UK even  earlier  than originally  scheduled.

Silences  may be thoughtful,  or they may be empty  when  a person  has nothing  to say. A silence  in a conversation  may also show  stubbornness,  uneasiness,  or worry.  Silence  may be viewed  by some  cultural  groups  as extremely  uncomfortable;  therefore  attempts  may be made  to fill every  gap (\u95f4\u9699 ) with conversation.  Persons  in other  cultural  groups  value  silence  and view  it as necessary  for understanding  a person\u2019s  needs.   Many  Native  Americans  value  silence  and feel it is a basic  part of communicating  among  people,  just as some  traditional  Chinese  and Thai persons  do. Therefore,  when  a person  from  one of these  cultures  is speaking  and suddenly  stops,  what  maybe  implied  (\u6697\u793a ) is that the person  wants  the listener  to consider  what  has been  said before  continuing.  In these  cultures,  silence  is a call for reflection.  Other  cultures  may use silence  in other  ways,  particularly  when  dealing  with conflicts  among  people  or in relationships  of people  with different  amounts  of power.  For example,  Russian,  French,  and Spanish  persons  may use silence  to show  agreement  between  parties  about  the topic  under  discussion.  However,  Mexicans  may use silence  when  instructions  are given  by a person  in authority  rather  than be rude to that person  by arguing  with him or her. In still another  use, persons  in Asian  cultures  may view  silence  as a sign of respect,  particularly  to an elder  or a person  in authority.  Nurses  and other  care-givers  need  to be aware  of the possible  meanings  of silence  when  they come  across  the personal  anxiety  their patients  may be experiencing.  Nurses  should  recognize  their own personal  and cultural  construction  of silence  so that a patient\u2019s  silence  is not interrupted  too early  or allowed  to go on unnecessarily.  A nurse  who understands  the healing  (\u6cbb\u6108 ) value  of silence  can use this understanding  to assist  in the care of patients  from  their own and from  other    cultures.  32. What  does the author  say about  silence  in conversations?  A. It implies  anger.              B. It promotes  friendship.  C. It is culture-specific.           D. It is content-based.  33. Which  of the following  people  might  regard  silence  as a call for careful  thought?  A. The Chinese.     B. The French.     C. The Mexicans.    D. The Russians.  34. What  does the author  advise  nurses  to do about  silence?  A. Let it continue  as the patient  pleases.     B. Break  it while  treating  patients.  C. Evaluate  its harm  to patients.         D. Make  use of its healing  effects.  35. What  may be the best title for the text?  A. Sound  and Silence               B. What  It Means  to Be Silent  C. Silence  to Native  Americans       D.

I put a small  set of Tinkertoys  in front  of each student,  and said:  \u201cMake  something  out of the Tinkertoys.  You have  45 minutes  today  \u2015 and 45 minutes  each day for the rest of the week.\u201d  A few students  hesitated  to start.  They  waited  to see what  the rest of the class  would  do. Several  others  checked  the instructions  and made  something  according  to one of the model  plans  provided.  Another  group  built something  out of their own imaginations.    Once  I had a boy who worked  experimentally  with Tinkertoys  in his free time.  His constructions  filled  a shelf  in the art classroom  and a good  part of his bedroom  at home.  I was delighted  at the presence  of such a student.  Here  was an exceptionally  creative  mind  at work.  His presence  meant  that I had an unexpected  teaching  assistant  in class  whose  creativity  would  infect  (\u611f\u67d3 ) other  students.  Encouraging  this kind of thinking  has a downside . I ran the risk of losing  those  students  who had a different  style  of thinking.  Without  fail one would  declare,  \u201cBut  I\u2019m just not creative.\u201d  \u201cDo you dream  at night  when  you\u2019re  asleep?\u201d  \u201cOh,  sure.\u201d  \u201cSo tell me one of your most  interesting  dreams.\u201d  The student  would  tell something  wildly  imaginative.  Flying  in the sky or in a time machine  or growing  three  heads.  \u201cThat\u2019s  pretty  creative.  Who  does that for you?\u201d  \u201cNobody.  I do it.\u201d \u201cReally  \u2015 at night,  when  you\u2019re  asleep?\u201d  \u201cSure.\u201d  \u201cTry  doing  it in the daytime,  in class,  okay?\u201d  25. The teacher  used Tinkertoys  in class  in order  to ________?  A. know  more  about  the students     B. make  the lessons  more  exciting  C. raise  the students\u2019  interest  in art   D. teach  the students  about  toy design  26. What  do we know  about  the boy mentioned  in Paragraph  3? A. He liked  to help his teacher.      B. He preferred  to study  alone.  C. He was active  in class.           D. He was imaginative.  27. What  does the underlined  word  \u201cdownside\u201d  in Paragraph  4 probably  mean?  A. Mistake.     B. Drawback.       C. Difficulty.      D. Burden.  28.

Think  of the people  who belong  to book  groups.  They  choose  books  to read and then meet  to discuss  them.  Now,  the website  BookCrossing.com  turns  the page  on the traditional  idea of a book  group.  Members  go on the site and register  the books  they own and would  like to share.  BookCrossing  provides  an identification  number  to stick  inside  the book.  Then  the person  leaves  it in a public  place,  hoping  that the book  will have  an adventure,  traveling  far and wide  with each new reader  who finds  it. Bruce  Pederson,  the managing  director  of BookCrossing,  says,  \u201cThe  two things  that change  your life are the people  you meet  and books  you read.  BookCrossing  combines  both.\u201d  Members  leave  books  on park benches  and buses,  in train stations  and coffee  shops.  Whoever  finds  their book  will go to the site and record  where  they found  it. People  who find a book  can also leave  a journal  entry  describing  what  they thought  of it. E-mails  are then sent to the BookCrossing  to keep  them  updated  about  where  their books  have  been  found.  Bruce  Peterson  says the idea is for people  not to be selfish  by keeping  a book  to gather  dust on a shelf  at home.  BookCrossing  is part of a trend  among  people  who want  to get back  to the \u201creal\u201d  and not the virtual  (\u865a\u62df ). The site now has more  than one million  members  in more  than one hundred  thirty-five  countries.  29. Why  does the author  mention  book  groups  in the first paragraph?  A.

Frank  Hurley\u2019s  pictures  would  be outstanding  \u2015 undoubtedly  first-rate  photo-journalism  \u2015 if they had been  made  last week.  In fact, they were  shot from  1914  through  1916,  most  of them  after a disastrous  shipwreck  (\u6d77 \u96be ), by a cameraman  who had no reasonable  expectation  of survival.  Many  of the images  were  stored  in an ice chest,  under  freezing  water,  in the damaged  wooden  ship.  The ship was the Endurance , a small,  tight,  Norwegian-built  three-master  that was intended  to take Sir Ernest  Shackleton  and a small  crew  of seamen  and scientists,  27 men in all, to the southernmost  shore  of Antarctica\u2019s  Weddell  Sea. From  that point  Shackleton  wanted  to force  a passage  by dog sled (\u96ea\u6a47 ) across  the continent.  The journey  was intended  to achieve  more  than what  Captain  Robert  Falcon  Scott  had done.  Captain  Scott  had reached  the South  Pole early  in 1912  but had died with his four companions  on the march  back.  As writer  Caroline  Alexander  makes  clear  in her forceful  and well-researched  story  The Endurance , adventuring  was even  then a thoroughly  commercial  effort.  Scott\u2019s  last journey,  completed  as he lay in a tent dying  of cold and hunger,  caught  the world\u2019s  imagination,  and a film made  in his honor  drew  crowds.  Shackleton,  a onetime  British  merchant-navy  officer  who had got to within  100 miles  of the South  Pole in 1908,  started  a business  before  his 1914  voyage  to make  money  from  movie  and still photography.  Frank  Hurley,  a confident  and gifted  Australian  photographer  who knew  the Antarctic,  was hired  to make  the images,  most  of which  have  never  before  been  published.  33. What  do we know  about  the photos  taken  by Hurley?    A. They  were  made  last week.         B. They  showed  undersea  sceneries.  C. They  were  found  by a cameraman.   D. They  recorded  a disastrous  adventure.  34. Who  reached  the South  Pole first according  to the text?  A. Frank  Hurley.             B. Ernest  Shackleton.  C. Robert  Falcon  Scott.        D. Caroline  Alexander.  35. What  does Alexander  think  was the purpose  of the 1914  voyage?  A. Artistic  creation.        B. Scientific  research.  C. Money  making.         D.

They settled in at a comfortable East Side cafe and within minutes, another customer was approaching their table.\u201cHey, aren\u2019t you from Mississippi?\u201d the elegant, white-haired writer remembered being asked by the stranger. \u201cI\u2019m from Mississippi too.\u201d   Without a second thought, the woman joined the Welty party.

By the time the group got up to leave, it was pouring outside. Welty\u2019s new friends immediately sent a waiter to find a cab. Heading back downtown toward her hotel, her big-city friends were amazed at the turn of events that had changed their Big Apple dinner into a Mississippi state reunion (\u56e2\u805a).\u201cMy friends said: \u2018Now we believe your stories,\u2019\u201d Welty added. \u201cAnd I said: \u2018Now you know. These are the people that make me write them.\u2019\u201dSitting on a sofa in her room, Welty, a slim figure in a simple gray dress, looked pleased with this explanation.\u201cI don\u2019t make them up,\u201d she said of the characters in her fiction these last 50 or so years. \u201cI don\u2019t have to.\u201dBeauticians, bartenders, piano players and people with purple hats, Welty\u2019s people come from afternoons spent visiting with old friends, from walks through the streets of her native Jackson, Miss., from conversations overheard on a bus. It annoys Welty that, at 78, her left ear has now given out. Sometimes, sitting on a bus or a train, she hears only a fragment (\u7247\u6bb5) of a particularly interesting story.25.

It\u2019s called Apple Day but in practice it\u2019s more like Apple Month. The day itself is on October 21, but since it has caught on, events now spread out over most of October around Britain.Visiting an apple event is a good chance to see, and often taste, a wide variety of apples. To people who are used to the limited choice of apples such as Golden Delicious and Royal Gala in supermarkets, it can be quite an eye opener to see the range of classical apples still in existence, such as Decio which was grown by the Romans. Although it doesn\u2019t taste of anything special, it\u2019s still worth a try, as is the knobbly (\u591a\u7599\u7629\u7684) Cat\u2019s Head which is more of a curiosity than anything else.There are also varieties developed to suit specific local conditions. One of the very best varieties for eating quality is Orleans Reinette, but you\u2019ll need a warm, sheltered place with perfect soil to grow it, so it\u2019s a pipe dream for most apple lovers who fall for it.At the events, you can meet expert growers and discuss which ones will best suit your conditions, and because these are family affairs, children are well catered for with apple-themed fun and games.Apple Days are being held at all sorts of places with an interest in fruit, including stately gardens and commercial orchards (\u679c\u56ed). If you want to have a real orchard experience, try visiting the National Fruit Collection at Brogdale, near Faversham in Kent.28. What can people do at the apple events?A. Attend experts\u2019 lectures.             \tB. Visit fruit-loving families.C. Plant fruit trees in an orchard.     \t\tD. Taste many kinds of apples.29. What can we learn about Decio?A. It is a new variety.                \tB. It has a strange look.C. It is rarely seen now.               \tD. It has a special taste.30.

If it bleeds, it leads. No news is good news, and good news is no news. Those are the classic rules for the evening broadcasts and the morning papers. But now that information is being spread and monitored (\u76d1\u63a7) in different ways, researchers are discovering new rules. By tracking people\u2019s e-mails and online posts, scientists have found that good news can spread faster and farther than disasters and sob stories.   \u201cThe \u2018if it bleeds\u2019 rule works for mass media,\u201d says Jonah Berger, a scholar at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cThey want your eyeballs and don\u2019t care how you\u2019re feeling. But when you share a story with your friends, you care a lot more how they react. You don\u2019t want them to think of you as a Debbie Downer.\u201d   Researchers analyzing word-of-mouth communication \u2014 e-mails, Web posts and reviews, face-to-face conversations \u2014 found that it tended to be more positive than negative (\u6d88\u6781\u7684), but that didn\u2019t necessarily mean people preferred positive news. Was positive news shared more often simply because people experienced more good things than bad things? To test for that possibility, Dr. Berger looked at how people spread a particular set of news stories: thousands of articles on The New York Times\u2019 website. He and a Penn colleague analyzed the \u201cmost e-mailed\u201d list for six months. One of his first findings was that articles in the science section were much more likely to make the list than non-science articles. He found that science amazed Times\u2019 readers and made them want to share this positive feeling with others.Readers also tended to share articles that were exciting or funny, or that inspired negative feelings like anger or anxiety, but not articles that left them merely sad. They needed to be aroused (\u6fc0\u53d1) one way or the other, and they preferred good news to bad. The more positive an article, the more likely it was to be shared, as Dr. Berger explains in his new book, \u201cContagious: Why Things Catch On.\u201d 32.

They\u2019re careful with their words.34. Which tended to be the most e-mailed according to Dr. Berger\u2019s research?A. Sports news.      \t  B. Science articles.    \t\tC.

Trying  to help injured,  displaced  or sick creatures  can be heartbreaking;  survival  is never  certain.  However,  when  it works,  it is simply  beautiful.   I got a rescue  call from  a woman  in Muttontown.  She had found  a young  owl (\u732b\u5934\u9e70 ) on the ground.  When  I arrived,  I saw a 2-to 3-week-old  owl. It had already  been  placed  in a carrier  for safety.   I examined  the chick  (\u96cf\u9e1f ) and it seemed  fine. If I could  locate  the nest, I might  have  been  able to put it back,  but no luck.  My next work  was to construct  a nest and anchor  it in a tree.  The homeowner  was very helpful.  A wire basket  was found.  I put some  pine branches  into the basket  to make  this nest safe and comfortable.  I placed  the chick  in the nest, and it quickly  calmed  down.   Now  all that was needed  were  the parents,  but they were  absent.  I gave  the homeowner  a recording  of the hunger  screams  of owl chicks.  These  advertise  the presence  of chicks  to adults;  they might  also encourage  our chick  to start calling  as well.  I gave  the owner  as much  information  as possible  and headed  home  to see what  news  the night  might  bring.   A nervous  night  to be sure,  but sometimes  the spirits  of nature  smile  on us all!   The homeowner  called  to say that the parents  had responded  to the recordings.  I drove  over and saw the chick  in the nest looking  healthy  and active.  And it was accompanied  in the nest by the greatest  sight  of all \u2014 LUNCH!  The parents  had done  their duty and would  probably  continue  to do so. 24. What  is unavoidable  in the author\u2019s  rescue  work  according  to paragraph  1? A. Efforts  made  in vain.               B. Getting  injured  in his work.  C. Feeling  uncertain  about  his future.     D. Creatures  forced  out of their homes.  25.

A. A new nest.   B. Some  food.    C. A recording.    D. Its parents.  27. How  would  the author  feel about  the outcome  of the event?  A. It\u2019s unexpected.    B. It\u2019s beautiful.    C.

UNESCO(  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and Cultural  Organization)  recently  set April  30 as a day to raise  awareness  of jazz music,  its significance,  and its potential  as a unifying  (\u8054\u5408 ) voice  across  cultures.  Despite  the celebrations,  though,  in the U.S. the jazz audience  continues  to shrink  and grow  older,  and the music  has failed  to connect  with younger  generations.  It\u2019s Jason  Moran\u2019s  job to help change  that. As the Kennedy  Center\u2019s  artistic  adviser  for jazz, Moran  hopes  to widen  the audience  for jazz, make  the music  more  accessible,  and preserve  its history  and culture.  \u201cJazz  seems  like it\u2019s not really  a part of the American  appetite,\u201d  Moran  tells National  Public  Radio\u2019s  reporter  Neal  Conan.  \u201cWhat  I\u2019m hoping  to accomplish  is that my generation  and younger  start to reconsider  and understand  that jazz is not black  and write  anymore.  It\u2019s actually  color,  and it\u2019s actually  digital.\u201d    Moran  says one of the problems  with jazz today  is that the entertainment  aspect  of the music  has been  lost. \u201cThe  music  can\u2019t  be presented  today  the way it was in 1908  or 1958.  It has to continue  to move,  because  the way the world  works  is not the same,\u201d  says Moran.  Last year,  Moran  worked  on a project  that arranged  Fats Waller\u2019s  music  for a dance  party,  \u201cJust  to kind of put it back  in the mind  that Waller  is dance  music  as much  as it is concert  music,\u201d  says Moran.  \u201cFor me, it\u2019s the recontextualization.  In music,  where  does the emotion  (\u60c5\u611f ) lie? Are we, as humans,  gaining  any insight  (\u611f\u609f ) on how to talk about  ourselves  and how something  as abstract  as a Charlie  Parker  record  gets us into a dialogue  about  our emotions  and our thoughts?  Sometimes  we lose sight  that the music  has a wider  context,\u201d  says Moran,  \u201cso I want  to continue  those  dialogues.  Those  are the things  I want  to foster.\u201d  28. Why  did UNESCO  set April  30 as International  Jazz Day?  A. To remember  the birth  of jazz. B. To protect  cultural  diversity.  C. To encourage  people  to study  music.  D. To recognize  the value  of jazz. 29. What  does the underlined  word  \u201cthat\u201d  in paragraph  3 refer  to? A. Jazz becoming  more  accessible.  B. The production  of jazz growing  faster.  C. Jazz being  less popular  with the young.  D. The jazz audience  becoming  larger.   30. What  can we infer  about  Moran\u2019s  opinion  on jazz?  A. It will disappear  gradually.          B.

Developed  by two doctors  in the U.S. Department  of Agriculture,  it\u2019s an excellent  water  collector.  Unfortunately,  you must  carry  the necessary  equipment  with you, since  it\u2019s all but impossible  to find natural  substitutes.  The only components  required,  though,  are a 5'\u00d75'  sheet  of clear  or slightly  milky  plastic,  six feet of plastic  tube,  and a container  \u2014 perhaps  just a drinking  cup \u2014 to catch  the water.  These  pieces  can be folded  into a neat little pack  and fastened  on your belt.     To construct  a working  still, use a sharp  stick  or rock to dig a hole four feet across  and three  feet deep.  Try to make  the hole in a damp  area to increase  the water  catcher\u2019s  productivity.  Place  your cup in the deepest  part of the hole.  Then  lay the tube in place  so that one end rests all the way in the cup and the rest of the line runs up \u2014 and out \u2014 the side of the hole.  Next,  cover  the hole with the plastic  sheet,  securing  the edges  of the plastic  with dirt and weighting  the sheet\u2019s  center  down  with a rock.  The plastic  should  now form  a cone  (\u5706\u9525\u4f53 ) with 45-degree-angled  sides.  The low point  of the sheet  must  be centered  directly  over,  and no more  than three  inches  above,  the cup.  The solar  still works  by creating  a greenhouse  under  the plastic.  Ground  water  evaporates  (\u84b8\u53d1 ) and collects  on the sheet  until small  drops  of water  form,  run down  the material  and fall off into the cup. When  the container  is full, you can suck the refreshment  out through  the tube,  and won\u2019t  have  to break  down  the still every  time you need  a drink.   32. What  do we know  about  the solar  still equipment  from  the first paragraph?  A. It\u2019s delicate.    B. It\u2019s expensive.    C. It\u2019s complex.    D. It\u2019s portable.  33.

When  the studio  didn\u2019t  want  me for the film \u2014 it wanted  somebody  as well known  as Paul \u2014 he stood  up for me. I don\u2019t  know  how many  people  would  have  done  that; they would  have  listened  to their agents  or the studio  powers.  The friendship  that grew  out of the experience  of making  that film and The Sting  four years  later had its root in the fact that although  there  was an age difference,  we both came  from  a tradition  of theater  and live TV. We were  respectful  of craft\uff08\u6280\u827a\uff09and focused  on digging  into the characters  we were  going  to play.  Both  of us had the qualities  and virtues  that are typical  of American  actors:  humorous,  aggressive,  and making  fun of each other  \u2014 but always  with an underlying  affection.  Those  were  also at the core\uff08\u6838\u5fc3\uff09 of our relationship  off the screen.  We shared  the brief  that if you\u2019re  fortunate  enough  to have  success,  you should    put something  back  \u2014 he with his Newman\u2019s  Own  food and his Hole  in the Wall  camps  for kids who are seriously  ill, and me with Sundance  and the institute  and the festival.  Paul and I didn\u2019t  see each other  all that regularly,  but sharing  that brought  us together.  We supported  each other  financially  and by showing  up at events.  I last saw him a few months  ago. He\u2019d  been  in and out of the hospital.  He and I both knew  what  the deal was, and we didn\u2019t  talk about  it. Ours  was a relationship  that didn\u2019t  need  a lot of words.  24. Why  was the studio  unwilling  to give the role to author  at first?  A. Paul Newman  wanted  it.        B. The studio  powers  didn\u2019t  like his agent.  C. He wasn\u2019t  famous  enough.       D. The director  recommended  someone  else. 25. Why  did Paul and the author  have  a lasting  friendship?  A. They  were  of the same  age.       B. They  worked  in the same  theater.  C. They  were  both good  actors.       D. They  had similar  charactertics.  26. What  does the underlined  word  \u201cthat\u201d  in paragraph  3 refer  to? A. Their  belief.             B. Their  care for children.  C. Their  success.            D. Their  support  for each other.  27. What  is the author\u2019s  purpose  in writing  the test? A. To show  his love of films.       B. To remember  a friend.  C. To introduce  a new movie.       D.

The vehicle  \u2014 named  the Transition  \u2013 has two seats , four wheels  and wings  that fold up so it can be driven  like a car. The Transition,  which  flew at 1,400  feet for eight  minutes  last month,  can reach  around  70 miles  per hour on the road and 115 in the air. It flies using  a 23-gallon  tank of gas and bums  5 gallons  per hour in the air. On the ground,  it gets 35 miles  per gallon.  Around  100 people  have  already  put down  a $10,000  deposit  to get a Transition  when  they go on sale, and those  numbers  will likely  rise after Terrafugia  introduces    the Transition  to the public  later this week  at the New  York  Auto  Show.  But don\u2019t  expect  it to show  up in too many  driveways.  It\u2019s expected  to cost $279,000.  And it won\u2019t  help if you\u2019re  stuck  in traffic.  The car needs  a runway.  Inventors  have  been  trying  to make  flying  cars since  the 1930s,  according  to Robert  Mann,  an airline  industry  expert.  But Mann  thinks  Terrafugia  has come  closer  than anyone  to making  the flying  car a reality.  The govemment  has already  permitted  the company  to use special  materials  to make  it easier  for the vehicle  to fly. The Transition  is now going  through  crash  tests to make  sure it meets  federal  safety  standards.  Mann  said Terrafugia  was helped  by the Federal  Aviation  Administration\u2019s  decision  five years  ago to create  a separate  set of standards  for light sport  aircraft,  which  are lower  than those  pilots  of larger  planes . Terrafugia  says an owner  would  need  to pass a test and complete  20 hours  of flying  time to be able to fly the Transition,  a requirement  pilots  would  find redatively  easy to meet.  28. What  is the first paragraph  mainly  about?  A. The basic  data of the Transition.      B. The advantages  of flying  cars. C. The potential  market  for flying  cars.  D. The designers  of the Transition.  29. Why  is the Transition  unlikely  to show  up in too many  driveways?  A. It causes  traffic  jams.              B. It is difficult  to operate.  C. It is very expensive.               D. It bums  too much  fuel. 30. What  is the government\u2019s  attitude  to the development  of the flying  car? A. Cautious .      B. Favorable.      C.

Back  in 1983,  two scientists,  Jack Schultz  and Ian Baldwin,  reported  that young  maple  trees  getting  bitten  by insects  send out a particular  smell  that neighboring  plants  can get. These    chemicals  come  from  the injured  parts  of the plant  and seem  to be an alarm.  What  the plants  pump  through  the air is a mixture  of chemicals  known  as volatile  organic  compounds,  VOCs  for short.  Scientists  have  found  that all kinds  of plants  give out VOCs  when  being  attacked.  It\u2019s a plant\u2019s  way of crying  out. But is anyone  listening?  Apparently.  Because  we can watch  the neighbours  react.  Some  plants  pump  out smelly  chemicals  to keep  insects  away.  But others  do double  duty.  They  pump  out perfumes  designed  to attract  different  insects  who are natural  enemies  to the attackers.  Once  they arrive,  the tables  are turned . The attacker  who was lunching  now becomes  lunch.  In study  after study,  it appears  that these  chemical  conversations  help the neighbors.  The damage  is usually  more  serious  on the first plant,  but the neighbors,  relatively  speaking,  stay safer  because  they heard  the alarm  and knew  what  to do. Does  this mean  that plants  talk to each other?  Scientists  don\u2019t  know.  Maybe  the first plant  just made  a cry of pain or was sending  a message  to its own branches,  and so, in effect,  was talking  to itself.  Perhaps  the neighbors  just happened  to \u201coverhear\u201d  the cry. So information  was exchanged,  but it wasn\u2019t  a true, intentional  back  and forth.  Charles  Darwin,  over 150 years  ago, imagined  a world  far busier,  noisier  and more  intimate  (\u4eb2\u5bc6\u7684 ) than the world  we can see and hear.  Our senses  are weak.

It was a scene that had been repeated many times in the theater\u2019s 75-year history. This time, however, the cleanup was a little different. As one group of workers carried out the rubbish, another group began removing seats and other theater equipment in preparation for the building\u2019s end.The film classic The Last Picture Show was the last movie shown in the old theater. Though the movie is 30 years old, most of the 250 seats were filled with teary-eyed audience wanting to say good-bye to the old building. Theater owner Ed Bradford said he chose the movie because it seemed appropriate. The movie is set in a small town where the only movie theater is preparing to close down.Bradford said that large modern theaters in the city made it impossible for the Plaza to compete. He added that the theater\u2019s location (\u4f4d\u7f6e) was also a reason. \u201cThis used to be the center of town,\u201d he said. \u201cNow the area is mostly office buildings and warehouses.\u201dLast week some city officials suggested the city might be interested in turning the old theater into a museum and public meeting place. However, these plans were abandoned because of financial problems. Bradford sold the building and land to a local development firm, which plans to build a shopping complex on the land where the theater is located.The theater audience said good-bye as Bradford locked the doors for the last time.

Fourteen wolves were caught in Canada and transported to the park. By last year, the Yellowstone wolf population had grown to more than 170 wolves.Gray wolves once were seen here and there in the Yellowstone area and much of the continental United States, but they were gradually displaced by human development. By the 1920s, wolves had practically disappeared from the Yellowstone area. They went farther north into the deep forests of Canada, where there were fewer humans around.The disappearance of the wolves had many unexpected results. Deer and elk populations \u2014 major food sources (\u6765\u6e90) for the wolf \u2014 grew rapidly. These animals consumed large amounts of vegetation (\u690d\u88ab), which reduced plant diversity in the park. In the absence of wolves, coyote populations also grew quickly. The coyotes killed a large percentage of the park\u2019s red foxes, and completely drove away the park\u2019s beavers.As early as 1966, biologists asked the government to consider reintroducing wolves to Yellowstone Park. They hoped that wolves would be able to control the elk and coyote problems. Many farmers opposed the plan because they feared that wolves would kill their farm animals or pets.    The government spent nearly 30 years coming up with a plan to reintroduce the wolvers. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service carefully monitors and manages the wolf packs in Yellowstone. Today, the debate continues over how well the gray wolf is fitting in at Yellowstone. Elk, deer, and coyote populations are down, while beavers and red fores have made a comeback. The Yellowstone wolf project has been a valuable experiment to help biologists decide whether to reintroduce wolves to other parts of the country as well.28. What is the text mainly about?A.

Phil Blythe explains: \u201cFor many older people, particularly those living alone or in the country, driving is important for preserving their independence, giving them the freedom to get out and about without having to rely on others.\u201d\u201cBut we all have to accept that as we get older our reactions slow down and this often results in people avoiding any potentially challenging driving conditions and losing confidence in their driving skills. The result is that people stop driving before they really need to.\u201dDr Amy Guo, the leading researcher on the older driver study, explains, \u201cThe Drive LAB is helping us to understand what the key points and difficulties are for older drivers and how we might use technology to address these problems.\u201cFor example, most of us would expect older drivers always go slower than everyone else but surprisingly, we found that in 30mph zones they struggled to keep at a constant speed and so were more likely to break the speed limit and be at risk of getting fined. We\u2019re looking at the benefits of systems which control their speed as a way of preventing that.\u201cWe hope that our work will help with technological solutions (\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848) to ensure that older drivers stay safer behind the wheel.\u201d32. What is the purpose of the Drive LAB?A. To explore newmeans of transport.       B. To design new types of cars.C. To find out older driver\u2019s problems.      D. To teach people traffic rules.33. Why is driving important for older people according to Phil Blythe?A. It keeps them independent.      B. It helps them save time.C. It builds up their strength.       D. It cures their mental illnesses.34. What do researchers hope to do for older drivers?A. Improve their driving skills.         B. Develop driver-assist technologles.C. Provide tips on repairing their cars.   D. Organize regular physical checkups.35. What is the best title for the text?A. A new Model Electric Car      B. A Solution to Traffic ProblemC.

When  the the world  was still   populated  by hunter-gatherers,  small,  tightly  knit (\u8054\u7cfb ) groups  developed  their own patterns  of speech  independent  of each other.  Some  language  experts  believe  that 10,000  years  ago, when  the world  had just five to ten million  people,  they spoke  perhaps  12,000  languages  between  them.  Soon  afterwards,  many  of those  people  started  settling  down  to become  farmers,  and their languages  too became  more  settled  and fewer  in number.  In recent  centres,  trade,  industrialisation , the development  of the nation-state  and the spread  of universal  compulsory  education.  Especially  glbalisation  and better  communications  in the past few decades,  all have  caused  many  Languages  to disappear,  and dominant  languages  such as English . Spanish  and Chinese  are increasingly  taking  over.  At present,  the world  has about  6,800 languages.  The distribution  of these  languages  is hugely  uneven.  The general  rule is that mild zones  have  relatively  few languages.  Often  spoken  by many  people  while  hot, wet zones  have  lots, often  spoken  by small  numbers.  Europe  has only around  200 Languages:  the Americas  about  1,000.  Africa  2,400; and Asia and the Pacific  perhaps  3,200,  of which  Papua  New  Guinea  alone  accounts  for well over 800. The median  number  (\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570 ) of speakers  is a mere  6.000,  which  means  that half the worlds  languages  are spoken  by fewer  people  than that. Already  well over 400 of the total of 6,800  languages  are close  to extinction( \u6d88\u4ea1), with only a few elderly  speakers  left. Pick,  at random,  Busuu  in Cameroon  (eight  remaining  speakers),  Chiapaneco  in Mexico(150).  Lipan  Apache  in the United  States  (two or three)  or Wadjigu  in Australia  (one,  with a question-mark):  none  of these  seems  to have  much  chance  of survival.  28. What  can we infer  about  languages  in huntergatherer  times?   A.They  developed  very fast.    B. They  were  large  in number.  C. They  had similar  patters.     D. They  were  closely  connected  29. Which  of the following  best explains  \u201cdominant \u201d underlined  in paragraph  2\uff1f A.Complex.     B. Advanced.       C.Powerful.     D.Modem.  30.

That\u2019s  bad news  for the environment  \u2014 and our wallets  \u2014 as these  outdated  devices  consume  much  more  energy  than the newer  ones that do the same  things.  To figure  out how much  power  these  devices  are using,  Callie  Babbitt  and her colleagues  at the Rochester  Institute  of Technology  in New  York  tracked  the environmental  costs  for each product  throughout  its life \u2014 from  when  its minerals  are mined  to when  we stop using  the device.  This method  provided  a readout  for how home  energy  use has evolved  since  the early  1990s.  Devices  were  grouped  by generation  \u2014 Desktop  computers,  basic  mobile  phones,  and box-set  TVs defined  1992.  Digital  cameras  arrived  on the scene  in 1997.  And MP3  players,  smart  phones,  and LCD  TVs entered  homes  in 2002,  before  tablets  and e-readers  showed  up in 2007.  As we accumulated  more  devices,  however,  we didn \u2019t throw  out our old ones.  \u201cThe living-room  television  is replaced  and gets planted  in the kids\u2019 room,  and suddenly  one day, you have  a TV in every  room  of the house, \u201d said one researcher.  The average  number  of electronic  devices  rose from  four per household  in 1992  to 13 in 2007.  We\u2019re not just keeping  these  old devices  \u2014 we continue  to use them.  According  to the analysis  of Babbitt \u2019s team,  old desktop  monitors  and box TVs with cathode  ray tubes  are the worst  devices  with their energy  consumption  and contribution  to greenhouse  gas emissions \uff08\u6392\u653e\uff09 more  than doubling  during  the 1992  to 2007  window.    So what \u2019s the solution\uff08\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff09 ? The team \u2019s data only went  up to 2007,  but the researchers  also explored  what  would  happen  if consumers  replaced  old products  with new electronics  that serve  more  than one function,  such as a tablet  for word  processing  and TV viewing.  They  found  that more  on-demand  entertainment  viewing  on tablets  instead  of TVs and desktop  computers  could  cut energy  consumption  by 44%.  32.

Why  did Babbitt's  team  conduct  the research?  A. To reduce  the cost of minerals.  B. To test the life cycle  of a product.  C. To update  consumers  on new technology.  D.

These  colourful  and sweet  jewels  from  British  Columbia\u2019s  fields  are little powerhouses  of nutritional  protection.  Of the common  berries,  strawberries  are highest  in vitamin  C, although,  because  of their seeds,  raspberries  contain  a little more  protein  (\u86cb\u767d\u8d28 ), iron and zinc (not that fruits  have  much  protein).  Blueberries  are particularly  high in antioxidants  (\u6297\u6c27\u5316 \u7269 \u8d28 ). The yellow  and orange  stone  fruits  such as peaches  are high in the carotenoids  we turn into vitamin  A and which  are antioxidants.  As for cherries  (\u6a31\u6843), they are so delicious  who cares?  However,  they are rich in vitamin  C. When  combined  with berries  or slices  of other  fruits,  frozen  bananas  make  an excellent  base for thick,  cooling  fruit shakes  and low fat \u201cice cream\u201d.  For this purpose,  select  ripe bananas  for freezing  as they are much  sweeter.  Remove  the skin and place  them  in plastic  bags or containers  and freeze.  If you like, a squeeze  of fresh  lemon  juice  on the bananas  will prevent  them  turning  brown.  Frozen  bananas  will last several  weeks,  depending  on their ripeness  and the temperature  of the freezer.  If you have  a juicer , you can simply  feed in frozen  bananas  and some  berries  or sliced  fruit.  Out comes  a \u201csoft-serve\u201d  creamy  dessert,  to be eaten  right  away.  This makes  a fun activity  for a children\u2019s  party;  they love feeding  the fruit and frozen  bananas  into the top of the machine  and watching  the ice cream  come  out below.  24. What  does the author  seem  to like about  cherries?  A. They  contain  protein.     B. They  are high in vitamin  A. C. They  have  a pleasant  taste.    D. They  are rich in antioxidants.  25. Why  is fresh  lemon  juice  used in freezing  bananas?  A. To make  them  smell  better.   B. To keep  their colour.  C. To speed  up their ripening.   D. To improve  their nutrition.  26. What  is \u201ca juicer\u201d  in the last paragraph?  A. A dessert.      B. A drink.   C. A container.      D. A machine.  27. From  which  is the text probably  taken?  A.

While  the decline  over the past decade  is steep  for teen readers,  some  data in the report  shows  that reading  remains  a big part of many  children\u2019s  lives,  and indicates  how parents  might  help encourage  more  reading.  According  to the report\u2019s  key findings,  \u201cthe proportion  (\u6bd4\u4f8b ) who say they \u2018hardly  ever\u2019  read for fun has gone  from  8 percent  of 13-year-olds  and 9 percent  of 17-year-olds  in 1984  to 22 percent  and 27 percent  respectively  today.\u201d  The report  data shows  that pleasure  reading  levels  for younger  children,  ages 2-8, remain  largely  the same.  But the amount  of time spent  in reading  each session  has declined,  from  closer  to an hour or more  to closer  to a half hour per session.  When  it comes  to technology  and reading,  the report  does little to counsel  (\u5efa\u8bae) parents  looking  for data about  the effect  of e-readers  and tablets  on reading.  It does point  out that many  parents  still limit  electronic  reading,  mainly  due to concerns  about  increased  screen  time.  The most  hopeful  data shared  in the report  shows  clear  evidence  of parents  serving  as examples  and important  guides  for their kids when  it comes  to reading.  Data  shows  that kids and teens  who do read frequently,  compared  to infrequent  readers,  have  more  books  in the home,  more  books  purchased  for them,  parents  who read more  often,  and parents  who set aside  time for them  to read.  As the end of school  approaches,  and school  vacation  reading  lists loom  (\u903c\u8fd1 ) ahead,  parents  might  take this chance  to step in and make  their own summer  reading  list and plan a family  trip to the library  or bookstore.  28.

It may harm  children\u2019s  health.     D. E-readers  are expensive.  31. How  should  parents  encourage  their children  to read more?  A. Act as role models  for them.    B.

What\u2019s  the problem?  It\u2019s possible  that we all have  compromised  conversational  intelligence.  It\u2019s more  likely  that none  of us start a conversation  because  it\u2019s awkward  and challenging,  or we think  it\u2019s annoying  and unnecessary.  But the next time you find yourself  among  strangers,  consider  that small  talk is worth  the trouble.  Experts  say it\u2019s an invaluable  social  practice  that results  in big benefits.  Dismissing  small  talk as unimportant  is easy,  but we can\u2019t  forget  that deep  relationships  wouldn\u2019t  even  exist  if it weren\u2019t  for casual  conversation.  Small  talk is the grease  (\u6da6\u6ed1\u5242 ) for social  communication,  says Bernardo  Carducci,  director  of the Shyness  Research  Institute  at Indiana  University  Southeast.  \u201cAlmost  every  great  love story  and each big business  deal begins  with small  talk,\u201d  he explains.  \u201cThe  key to successful  small  talk is learning  how to connect  with others,  not just communicate  with them.\u201d  In a 2014  study,  Elizabeth  Dunn,  associate  professor  of psychology  at UBC,  invited  people  on their way into a coffee  shop.  One group  was asked  to seek out an interaction  (\u4e92\u52a8 ) with its waiter;  the other,  to speak  only when  necessary.  The results  showed  that those  who chatted  with their server  reported  significantly  higher  positive  feelings  and a better  coffee  shop  experience.  \u201cIt\u2019s not that talking  to the waiter  is better  than talking  to your husband,\u201d  say Dunn.  \u201cBut  interactions  with peripheral  (\u8fb9\u7f18\u7684 ) members  of our social  network  matter  for our well-being  also.\u201d  Dunn  believes  that people  who reach  out to strangers  feel a significantly  greater  sense  of belonging,  a bond  with others.  Carducci  believes  developing  such a sense  of belonging  starts  with small  talk. \u201cSmall  talk is the basis  of good  manners,\u201d  he says.  32. What  phenomenon  is described  in the first paragraph?  A. Addiction  to smartphones.  B. Inappropriate  behaviours  in public  places.  C. Absence  of communication  between  strangers.  D.

People settle in these places because they are easy to get to and naturally suited to communications and trade. New York City, for example, is near a large harbour at the mouth of the Hudson River. Over 300 years its population grew gradually from 800 people to 8 million. But not all cities develop slowly over a long period of time. Boom towns grow from nothing almost overnight. In 1896, Dawson, Canada, was unmapped wilderness (\u8352\u91ce). But gold was discovered there in 1897, and two years later, it was one of the largest cities in the West, with a population of 30,000.Dawson did not have any of the natural conveniences of cities like London or Paris. People went there for gold. They travelled over snow-covered mountains and sailed hundreds of miles up icy rivers. The path to Dawson was covered with thirty feet of wet snow that could fall without warming. An avalanche(\u96ea\u5d29) once closed the path, killing 63 people. For many who made it to Dawson, however, the rewards were worth the difficult trip. Of the first 20,000 people who dug for gold, 4,000 got rich. About 100 of these stayed rich men for the rest of their lives.But no matter how rich they were, Dawson was never comfortable. Necessities like food and wood were very expensive. But soon, the gold that Dawson depended on had all been found. The city was crowded with disappointed people with no interest in settling down, and when they heard there were new gold discoveries in Alaska, they left Dawson City as quickly as they had come. Today, people still come and go \u2014 to see where the Canadian gold rush happened. Tourism is now the chief industry of Dawson City \u2014 its present population is 762.24. What attracted the early settlers to New York City?A. Its business culture.            B. Its small population.[\u6765]C. Its geographical position.        D. Its favourable climate.25. What do we know about those who first dug for gold in Dawson?A. Two-thirds of them stayed there.      B. One out of five people got rich.C. Almost everyone gave up.           D. Half of them died.26.

Wang Shu, a 49-year-old Chinese architect, won the 2012 Pritzker Architecture Prize \u2014 which is often referred to as the Nobel Prize in architecture \u2014 on February 28. He is the first Chinese citizen to win this award.Wang serves as head of the Architecture Department at the China Academy of Art (CAA). His office is located at the Xiangshan campus (\u6821\u56ed) of the university in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province. Many buildings on the campus are his original creations.The style of the campus is quite different from that of most Chinese universities. Many visitors were amazed by the complex architectural space and abundant building types. The curves (\u66f2\u7ebf) of the buildings perfectly match the rise and fall of hills, forming a unique view.Wang collected more than 7 million abandoned bricks of different ages. He asked the workers to use traditional techniques to make the bricks into walls, roofs and corridors. This creation attracted a lot of attention thanks to its mixture of modern and traditional Chinese elements (\u5143\u7d20).Wang\u2019s works show a deep understanding of modern architecture and a good knowledge of traditions. Through such a balance, he had created a new type of Chinese architecture, said Tadao Ando, the winner of the 1995 Pritzker Prize.Wang believes traditions should not be sealed in glass boxes at museums. \u201cThat is only evidence that traditions once existed,\u201d he said.\u201cMany Chinese people have a misunderstanding of traditions. They think tradition means old things from the past. In fact, tradition also refers to the things that have been developing and that are still being created,\u201d he said.\u201cToday, many Chinese people are learning Western styles and theories rather than focusing on Chinese traditions. Many people tend to talk about traditions without knowing what they really are,\u201d said Wang.\u5b66K]The study of traditions should be combined with practice. Otherwise, the recreation of traditions would be artificial and empty, he said.28.

What impressed visitors to the CAA Xiangshan campus most?A. Its hilly environment. \tB. Its large size.C. Its unique style.\t\t\tD. Its diverse functions.30.

Why do we often assume that more is more when it comes to kids and their belongings? The good news is that I can help my own kids learn earlier than I did how to live more with less. I found the pre-holidays a good time to encourage young children to donate less-used things, and it worked. Because of our efforts, our daughter Georgia did decide to donate a large bag of toys to a little girl whose mother was unable to pay for her holiday due to illness. She chose to sell a few larger objects that were less often used when we promised to put the money into her school fund (\u57fa\u91d1) (our kindergarten daughter is serious about becoming a doctor).For weeks, I\u2019ve been thinking of bigger, deeper questions: How do we make it a habit for them? And how do we train ourselves to help them live with, need, and use less? Yesterday, I sat with my son, Shepherd, determined to test my own theory on this. I decided to play with him with only one toy for as long as it would keep his interest. I expected that one toy would keep his attention for about five minutes, ten minutes, max. I chose a red rubber ball\u2014simple, universally available. We passed it, he tried to put it in his mouth, he tried bouncing it, rolling it, sitting on it, throwing it. It was totally, completely enough for him. Before I knew it an hour had passed and it was time to move on to lunch.We both became absorbed in the simplicity of playing together. He had my full attention and I had his. My little experiment to find joy in a single object worked for both of us.32. What do the words \u201cmore is more\u201d in paragraph 1 probably mean?A.

At present, these technologies are still expensive, though.Researchers from Georgia Tech say that they have come up with a low-cost device(\u88c5\u7f6e)that gets around this problem: a smart keyboard. This smart keyboard precisely measures the cadence(\u8282\u594f)with which one types and the pressure fingers apply to each key. The keyboard could offer a strong layer of security by analyzing things like the force of a user's typing and the time between key presses. These patterns are unique to each person. Thus, the keyboard can determine people's identities, and by extension, whether they should be given access to the computer it's connected to\u2014regardless of whether someone gets the password right.It also doesn't require a new type of technology that people aren't already familiar with. Everybody uses a keyboard and everybody types differently.In a study describing the technology, the researchers had 100 volunteers type the word \u201ctouch\u201dfour times using the smart keyboard. Data collected from the device could be used to recognize different participants based on how they typed, with very low error rates. The researchers say that the keyboard should be pretty straightforward to commercialize and is mostly made of inexpensive, plastic-like parts. The team hopes to make it to market in the near future.28. Why do the researchers develop the smart keyboard?A. To reduce pressure on keys.\tB. To improve accuracy in typingC.

I was the queen of the playground. Then came my tweens and teens, and mean girls and cool kids. They rose in the ranks not by being friendly but by smoking cigarettes, breaking rules and playing jokes on others, among whom I soon found myself.Popularity is a well-explored subject in social psychology. Mitch Prinstein, a professor of clinical psychology sorts the popular into two categories: the likable and the status seekers. The likables\u2019 plays-well-with-others qualities strengthen schoolyard friendships, jump-start interpersonal skills and, when tapped early, are employed ever after in life and work. Then there\u2019s the kind of popularity that appears in adolescence: status born of power and even dishonorable behavior.Enviable as the cool kids may have seemed, Dr. Prinstein\u2019s studies show unpleasant consequences. Those who were highest in status in high school, as well as those least liked in elementary school, are \u201cmost likely to engage(\u4ece\u4e8b)in dangerous and risky behavior.\u201dIn one study, Dr. Prinstein examined the two types of popularity in 235 adolescents, scoring the least liked, the most liked and the highest in status based on student surveys(\u8c03\u67e5\u7814\u7a76). \u201cWe found that the least well-liked teens had become more aggressive over time toward their classmates. But so had those who were high in status. It clearly showed that while likability can lead to healthy adjustment, high status has just the opposite effect on us.\"Dr. Prinstein has also found that the qualities that made the neighbors want you on a play date-sharing, kindness, openness \u2014 carry over to later years and make you better able to relate and connect with others.In analyzing his and other research\uff0cDr. Prinstein came to another conclusion: Not only is likability related to positive life outcomes, but it is also responsible for those outcomes, too. \"Being liked creates opportunities for learning and for new kinds of life experiences that help somebody gain an advantage, \u201d he said.32.

Yes, I\u2019ll do it.\u201dI\u2019m secretly relieved because I know there\u2019s real power in sharing volunteer responsibilities among many. The unwilling parent organizes the meal schedule, sends out emails, and collects money for end-of-season gifts. Somewhere along the way, the same parent ends up becoming an invaluable member of the team. The coach is able to focus on the kids while the other parents are relieved to be off the hook for another season. Handing out sliced oranges to bloodthirsty kids can be as exciting as watching your own kid score a goal.Still, most of us volunteers breathe a sigh of relief when the season comes to a close. That relief is coupled with a deep understanding of why the same people keep coming back for more: Connecting to the community(\u793e\u533a)as you freely give your time, money, skills, or services provides a real joy. Volunteering just feels so good.In that sense, I\u2019m pretty sure volunteering is more of a selfish act than I\u2019d freely like to admit. However, if others benefit in the process, and I get some reward too, does it really matter where my motivation lies?24. What can we infer about the parent from her reply in paragraph l\uff1fA.

Today $8 or $10 seems a small amount of money, but at that time these amounts were forbidding to most citizens. Accordingly, newspapers were read almost only by rich people in politics or the trades. In addition, most newspapers had little in them that would appeal to a mass audience. They were dull and visually forbidding. But the revolution that was taking place in the 1830s would change all that.The trend, then, was toward the \"penny paper\"-a term referring to papers made widely available to the public. It meant any inexpensive newspaper; perhaps more importantly it meant newspapers that could be bought in single copies on the street.This development did not take place overnight. It had been possible(but not easy)to buy single copies of newspapers before 1830,but this usually meant the reader had to go down to the printer's office to purchase a copy. Street sales were almost unknown. However, within a few years, street sales of newspapers would be commonplace in eastern cities. At first the price of single copies was seldom a penny-usually two or three cents was charged-and some of the older well-known papers charged five or six cents. But the phrase \"penny paper \" caught the public's fancy, and soon there would be papers that did indeed sell for only a penny.This new trend of newspapers for \"the man on the street\" did not begin well. Some of the early ventures(\u4f01\u4e1a)were immediate failures. Publishers already in business, people who were owners of successful papers, had little desire to change the tradition. It took a few youthful and daring businessmen to get the ball rolling.28. Which of the following best describes newspapers in America before the 1830s?A. Academic.\tB. Unattractive.\tC.

The researchers then tested how the monkeys combined\u2014or added\u2014the symbols to get the reward.Here's how Harvard Medical School scientist Margaret Livingstone, who led the team, described the experiment: In their cages the monkeys were provided with touch screens. On one part of the screen, a symbol would appear, and on the other side two symbols inside a circle were shown. For example, the number 7 would flash on one side of the screen and the other end would have 9 and 8. If the monkeys touched the left side of the screen they would be rewarded with seven drops of water or juice; if they went for the circle, they would be rewarded with the sum of the numbers\u201417 in this example.After running hundreds of tests, the researchers noted that the monkeys would go for the higher values more than half the time, indicating that they were performing a calculation, not just memorizing the value of each combination.When the team examined the results of the experiment more closely, they noticed that the monkeys tended to underestimate(\u4f4e\u4f30)a sum compared with a single symbol when the two were close in value\u2014sometimes choosing, for example, a 13 over the sum of 8 and 6. The underestimation was systematic: When adding two numbers, the monkeys always paid attention to the larger of the two, and then added only a fraction(\u5c0f\u90e8\u5206)of the smaller number to it.\"This indicates that there is a certain way quantity is represented in their brains, \"Dr. Livingstone says. \u201cBut in this experiment what they're doing is paying more attention to the big number than the little one.\u201d32.

There\u2019s a welcome familiarity - but also sometimes a slight suspicion that time has changed you both, and thus the relationship. But books don\u2019t change, people do. And that\u2019s what makes the act of rereading so rich and transformative.The beauty of rereading lies in the idea that our bond with the work is based on our present mental register. It\u2019s true, the older I get, the more I feel time has wings. But with reading, it\u2019s all about the present. It\u2019s about the now and what one contributes to the now, because reading is a give and take between author and reader. Each has to pull their own weight.There are three books I reread annually The first, which I take to reading every spring is Emest Hemningway\u2019s A Moveable Feast. Published in 1964, it\u2019s his classic memoir of 1920s Paris. The language is almost intoxicating (\u4ee4\u4eba\u9676\u9189\u7684)\uff0can aging writer looking back on an ambitious yet simpler time. Another is Annie Dillard\u2019s Holy the Firm, her poetic 1975 ramble (\u968f\u7b14) about everything and nothing. The third book is Julio Cortazar\u2019s Save Twilight: Selected Poems, because poetry. And because Cortazar.While I tend to buy a lot of books, these three were given to me as gifs, which might add to the meaning I attach to them. But I imagine that, while money is indeed wonderful and necessary, rereading an author\u2019s work is the highest currency a reader can pay them. The best books are the ones that open further as time passes. But remember, it\u2019s you that has to grow and read and reread in order to better understand your friends.24. Why does the author like rereading?A. It evaluates the writer-reader relationship.B. It\u2019s a window to a whole new world.C. It\u2019s a substitute for drinking with a friend.D. It extends the understanding of oneself.25. What do we know about the book A Moveable Feas!?A. It\u2019s a brief account of a trip.B. It\u2019s about Hemingway\u2019s life as a young man.C. It\u2019s a record of a historic event.D. It\u2019s about Hemingway\u2019s friends in Paris.26. What does the underlined word \uff02currency\uff02 in paragraph 4 refer to?A. DebtB. Reward.C. Allowance.D. Face value.27. What can we infer about the author from the text?A. He loves poetry.B. He\u2019s an editor.C. He\u2019s very ambitious.D.

It does, however, have its own problem.Race walkers are conditioned athletes. The longest track and field event at the Summer Olympics is the 50-kilometer race walk, which is about five miles longer than the marathon. But the sport\u2019s rules require that a race walker\u2019s knees stay straight through most of the leg swing and one foot remain in contact (\u63a5\u89e6) with the ground at all times. It\u2019s this strange form that makes race walking such an attractive activity, however, says Jaclyn Norberg, an assistant professor of exercise science at Salem State University in Salem, Mass.Like running, race walking is physically demanding, she says, According to most calculations, race walkers moving at a pace of six miles per hour would burn about 800 calories(\u5361\u8def\u91cc) per hour, which is approximately twice as many as they would burn walking, although fewer than running, which would probably burn about 1,000 or more calories per hour.However, race walking does not pound the body as much as running does, Dr. Norberg says. According to her research, runners hit the ground with as much as four times their body weight per step, while race walkers, who do not leave the ground, create only about 1.4 times their body weight with each step.As a result, she says, some of the injuries associated with running, such as runner\u2019s knee, are uncommon among race walkers. But the sport\u2019s strange form does place considerable stress on the ankles and hips, so people with a history of such injuries might want to be cautious in adopting the sport. In fact, anyone wishing to try race walking should probably first consult a coach or experienced racer to learn proper technique, she says. It takes some practice.28.

Recent studies have found positive effects. A study conducted in Youngstown\uff0cOhio\uff0cfor example, discovered that greener areas of the city experienced less crime. In another\uff0cemployees were shown to be 15% more productive when their workplaces were decorated with houseplants.The engineers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology(MIT)have taken it a step further changing the actual composition of plants in order to get them to perform diverse\uff0ceven unusual functions. These include plants that have sensors printed onto their leaves to show when they\u2019re short of water and a plant that can detect harmful chemicals in groundwater. \uff02We\u2019re thinking about how we can engineer plants to replace functions of the things that we use every day,\uff02explained Michael Strano, a professor of chemical engineering at MIT.One of his latest projects has been to make plants glow(\u53d1\u5149)in experiments using some common vegetables. Strano\u2019s team found that they could create a faint light for three-and-a-half hours. The light\uff0cabout one-thousandth of the amount needed to read by\uff0cis just a start. The technology, Strano said, could one day be used to light the rooms or even to turn tree into self-powered street lamps.in the future\uff0cthe team hopes to develop a version of the technology that can be sprayed onto plant leaves in a one-off treatment that would last the plant\u2019s lifetime. The engineers are also trying to develop an on and off\uff02switch\uff02where the glow would fade when exposed to daylight.Lighting accounts for about 7% of the total electricity consumed in the US. Since lighting is often far removed from the power source(\u7535\u6e90)-such as the distance from a power plant to street lamps on a remote highway-a lot of energy is lost during transmission(\u4f20\u8f93).Glowing plants could reduce this distance and therefore help save energy.32.

What is the function of the sensors printed on plant leaves by MIT engineer?A. To detect plants\u2019 lack of waterB. To change compositions of plantsC. To make the life of plants longer.D.

But some ecologists and fashion (\u65f6\u88c5)enthusiasts are trying to bring back the market for fur made from nutria(\u6d77\u72f8\u9f20).Unusual fashion shows in New Orleans and Brooklyn have showcased nutria fur made into clothes in different styles. \u201cIt sounds crazy to talk about guilt-free fur-unless you understand that the nutria are destroying vast wetlands every year\u201d, says Cree McCree, project director of Righteous Fur.Scientists in Louisiana were so concerned that they decided to pay hunters $5 a tail. Some of the fur ends up in the fashion shows like the one in Brooklyn last month.Nutria were brought there from Argentina by fur farmers and let go into the wild. \u201cThe ecosystem down there can\u2019t handle this non-native species(\u7269\u79cd).It\u2019s destroying the environment. It\u2019s them or us.\u201d says Michael Massimi, an expert in this field.The fur trade kept nutria in check for decades\uff0cbut when the market for nutria collapsed in the late 1980s\uff0cthe cat-sized animals multiplied like crazy.Biologist Edmond Mouton runs the nutria control program for Louisiana. He says it\u2019s not easy to convince people that nutria fur is green, but he has no doubt about it. Hunters bring in more than 300,000 nutria tails a year, so part of Mouton\u2019s job these days is trying to promote fur.Then there\u2019s Righteous Fur and its unusual fashion.

I have for as long as I can remember. I was always an enthusiastic reader, sometimes reading up to three books a day as a child. Stories were like air to me and while other kids played ball or went to parties, I lived out adventures through the books I checked out from the library.My first job was working at the Ukiah Library when I was 16 years old .It was a dream job and I did everything from shelving books to reading to the children for story time.As I grew older and became a mother, the library took on a new place and an added meaning in my life. I had several children and books were our main source(\u6765\u6e90) of entertainment. It was a big deal for us to load up and go to the local library, where my kids could pick out books to read or books they wanted me to read to them.I always read ,using different voices ,as though I were acting out the stories with my voice and they loved it !It was a special time to bond with my children and it filled them with the wonderment of books .Now, I see my children taking their children to the library and I love that the excitement of going to the library lives on form generation to generation.As a novelist, I\u2019ve found a new relationship with libraries. I encourage readers to go to their local library when they can\u2019t afford to purchase a book. I see libraries as a safe haven(\u907f\u98ce\u6e2f) for readers and writers, a bridge that helps put together a reader with a book. Libraries, in their own way, help fight book piracy(\u76d7\u7248\u884c\u4e3a) and 1 think all writers should support libraries in a significant way when they can. Encourage readers to use the library. Share library announcements on your social media. Frequent them and talk about them when you can.32. Which word best describes the author\u2019s relationship with books as a child?A. Cooperative.\tB. Uneasy.\tC. Inseparable.\tD. Casual.33. What does the underlined phrase \u201can added meaning\u201d in paragraph 3 refer to?A. Pleasure from working in the library.B. Joy of reading passed on in the family.C. Wonderment from acting out the stories.D. A closer bond developed with the readers.34. What does the author call on other writers to do?A. Sponsor book fairs.\tB. Write for social media.C.

They share a front door and a washing machine, but Rita Whitehead has her own kitchen, bathroom, bedroom and living room on the ground floor.\u201cWe floated the idea to my mum of sharing at a house,\u201d says Kathryn Whitehead.

Official reports suggest that the number of households with three generations living together had risen from 325,000 in 2001to 419,000 in 2013.Other varieties of multigenerational family are more common. Some people live with their elderly parents; many more adult children are returning to the family home, if they ever left. It is said that about 20% of 25-34-year-olds live with their parents, compared with 16% in 1991.The total number of all multigenerational households in Britain is thought to be about 1.8 million.Stories like that are more common in parts of the world where multigenerational living is more firmly rooted. In India, particularly outside cities, young women are expected to move in with their husband\u2019s family when they get married.28.

As scientists look deeper into our genes (\u57fa\u56e0), they are finding examples of human evolution in just the past few thousand years. People in Ethiopian highlands have adapted to living at high altitudes. Cattle -raising people in East Africa and northern Europe have gained a mutation (\u7a81\u53d8) that helps them digest milk as adults.On Thursday in an article published in Cell, a team of researchers reported a new kind of adaptation - not to air or to food, but to the ocean. A group of sea-dwelling people in Southeast Asia have evolved into better divers. The Bajau, as these people are known, number in the hundreds of thousands in Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. They have traditionally lived on houseboats; in recent times, they\u2019ve also built houses on stilts (\u652f\u67f1) in coastal waters. \u201cThey are simply a stranger to the land,\u201d said Redney C. Jubilado, a University of Hawaii researcher who studies the Bajau.Dr. Jubilado first met the Bajau while growing up on Samal Island in the Philippines. They made a living as divers, spearfishing or harvesting shellfish. \u201cWe were so amazed that they could stay underwater much longer than us local islanders,\u201d Dr. Jubilado said. \u201cI could see them actually walking under the sea.\u201dIn2015, Melissa Ilardo, then a graduate student in genetics at the University of Copenhagen, heard about the Bajau. She wondered if centuries of diving could have led to the evolution of physical characteristics that made the task easier for them. \u201cit seemed like the perfect chance for natural selection to act on a population,\u201d said Dr. Ilardo. She also said there were likely a number of other genes that help the Bajau dive.32. What does the author want to tell us by the examples in paragraph 1?A. Environmental adaptation of cattle raisers.\tB. New knowledge of human evolution.C. Recent findings of human origin.\tD. Significance of food selection.33. Where do the Bajau build their houses?A.

Rome\u2019s Colosseum was 157 feet tall and had 80 entrances, seating 50,000 people. However, that was small fry compared with the city\u2019s Circus Maximus, which accommodated around 250,000 people.These days, safety regulations-not to mention the modern sports fan\u2019s desire for a good view and comfortable seat\u2014tend to keep stadium capacities\uff08\u5bb9\u91cf\uff09 slightly lower. Even soccer fans tend to have a seat each; gone are the days of thousands standing to watch the match. For the biggest stadiums in the world, we have used data supplied by the World Atlas list so far, which ranks them by their stated permanent capacity, as well as updated information from official stadium websites.

But does one plastic straw or cup really make a difference? Artist Benjamin Von Wong wants you to know that it does. He builds massive sculptures out of plastic garbage, forcing viewers to re-examine their relationship to single-use plastic products. At the beginning of the year, the artist built a piece called \u201cStrawpocalypse,\u201d a pair of 10-foot-tall plastic waves, frozen mid-crash. Made of 168,000 plastic straws collected from several volunteer beach cleanups, the sculpture made its first appearance at the Estella Place shopping center in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Just 9% of global plastic waste is recycled. Plastic straws are by no means the biggest source\uff08\u6765\u6e90\uff09of plastic pollution but they\u2019ve recently come under fire because most people don\u2019t need them to drink with and, because of their small size and weight, they cannot be recycled. Every straw that\u2019s part of Von Wong\u2019s artwork likely came from a drink that someone used for only a few minutes. Once the drink is gone, the straw will take centuries to disappear. In a piece from 2018, Von Wong wanted to illustrate\uff08\u8bf4\u660e\uff09 a specific statistic: Every 60 seconds, a truckload\u2019s worth of plastic enters the ocean. For this work, titled \u201cTruckload of Plastic,\u201d Von Wong and a group of volunteers collected more than 10,000 pieces of plastic, which were then tied together to look like they\u2019d been dumped\uff08\u503e\u5012\uff09 from a truck all at once. Von Wong hopes that his work will also help pressure big companies to reduce their plastic footprint.28. What are Von Wong\u2019s artworks intended for?A. Beautifying the city he lives in.\tB.

Plastic straws are by no means the biggest source(\u6765\u6e90) of plastic pollution, but they\u2019ve recently come under fire because most people don\u2019t need them to drink with and, because of their small size and weight, they cannot be recycled. Every straw that\u2019s part of Von Wong\u2019s artwork likely came from a drink that someone used for only a few minutes.

The differences between most of the groups were statistically insignificant; however, the participants in the 70 decibels group \u2014 those exposed to a level of noise similar to background chatter in a coffee shop \u2014 significantly outperformed the other groups. Since the effects were small, this may suggest that our creative thinking does not differ that much in response to total silence and 85 decibels of background noise. But since the results at 70 decibels were significant, the study also suggests that the right level of background noise \u2014 not too loud and not total silence \u2014 may actually improve one\u2019s creative thinking ability. The right level of background noise may interrupt our normal patterns of thinking just enough to allow our imaginations to wander, without making it impossible to focus. This kind of \u201cdistracted focus\u201d appears to be the best state for working on creative tasks. So why do so many of us hate our open offices? The problem may be that, in our offices, we can\u2019t stop ourselves from getting drawn into others\u2019 conversations while we\u2019re trying to focus. Indeed, the researchers found that face-to-face interactions and conversations affect the creative process, and yet a coworking space or a coffee shop provides a certain level of noise while also providing freedom from interruptions.32 Why does the interviewer prefer a coworking space?A.

She's healthy, strong and already eager to play and explore. Her mother, Solio, is a first-time mum and she is doing a fantastic job.

Once, when trying a certain trick on the beam\uff08\u6a2a\u6746\uff09, I fell onto the stones, damaging a nerve in my hand, and Toby came over, helping me up: Safe, man. Safe. A few minutes later, when I landed the trick, my friends beat their boards loud, shouting: \u201c Safe! Safe! Safe!\u201d And that's what mattered\u2014landing tricks, being a good skater.When I was 15, my family moved to Washington. I tried skateboarding there, but the locals were far less welcoming. Within a couple of years, I'd given it up.When I returned to London in 2004, I found myself wandering down to Southbank, spending hours there. I've traveled back several times since, most recently this past spring. The day was cold but clear: tourists and Londoners stopped to watch the skaters. Weaving\uff08\u7a7f\u68ad\uff09among the kids who rushed by on their boards, I found my way to the beam. Then a rail\u2014thin teenager, in a baggy white T\u2014shirt, skidded\uff08\u6ed1\uff09up to the beam. He sat next to me. He seemed not to notice the man next to him. But soon I caught a few of his glances. \u201cI was a local here 20 years ago,\u201d I told him. Then, slowly, he began to nod his head. \u201cSafe, man.

This question has greatly interested humankind for centuries.Let's state clearly: Einstein was a genius. His face is almost the international symbol for genius. But we want to go beyond one man and explore the nature of genius itself. Why is it that some people are so much more intelligent or creative than the rest of us? And who are they? In the sciences and arts, those praised as geniuses were most often white men, of European origin. Perhaps this is not a surprise. It's said that history is written by the victors, and those victors set the standards for admission to the genius club. When contributions were made by geniuses outside the club\u2014women, or people of a different color or belief\u2014they were unacknowledged and rejected by others.A study recently published by Science found that as young as age six, girls are less likely than boys to say that members of their gender(\u6027\u522b)are \u201creally, really smart.\u201d Even worse, the study found that girls act on that belief: Around age six they start to avoid activities said to be for children who are \u201creally, really smart.\u201d Can our planet afford to have any great thinkers become discouraged and give up? It doesn't take a genius to know the answer: absolutely not.Here's the good news. In a wired world with constant global communication, we're all positioned to see flashes of genius wherever they appear. And the more we look, the more we will see that social factors(\u56e0\u7d20)like gender, race, and class do not determine the appearance of genius. As a writer says, future geniuses come from those with \u201cintelligence, creativity, perseverance(\u6bc5\u529b), and simple good fortune, who are able to change the world.\u201d12.

Y.\u2014Dorothy Woodruff and Rosamond Underwood\u2014traveled to a settlement in the Rocky Mountains to teach in a one-room schoolhouse. The girls had gone to Smith College. They wore expensive clothes. So for them to move to Elkhead, Colo. to instruct the children whose shoes were held together with string was a surprise. Their stay in Elkhead is the subject of Nothing Daunted: The Unexpected Education of Two Society Girls in the West by Dorothy Wickenden, who is a magazine editor and Dorothy Woodruff\u2019s granddaughter. Why did they go then? Well, they wanted to do something useful. Soon, however, they realized what they had undertaken.They moved in with a local family, the Harrisons, and, like them, had little privacy, rare baths, and a blanket of snow on their quilt when they woke up in the morning. Some mornings, Rosamond and Dorothy would arrive at the schoolhouse to find the children weeping from the cold. In spring, the snow was replaced by mud over ice. In Wickenden\u2019s book, she expanded on the history of the West and also on feminism, which of course influenced the girls\u2019 decision to go to Elkhead. A hair-raising section concerns the building of the railroads, which entailed (\u7275\u6d89) drilling through the Rockies, often in blinding snowstorms. The book ends with Rosamond and Dorothy\u2019s return to Auburn.Wickenden is a very good storyteller. The sweep of the land and the stoicism (\u575a\u5fcd) of the people move her to some beautiful writing. Here is a picture of Dorothy Woodruff, on her horse, looking down from a hill top: \u201cWhen the sun slipped behind the mountains, it shed a rosy glow all around them. Then a full moon rose. The snow was marked only by small animals: foxes, coyotes, mice, and varying hares, which turned white in the winter.\u201d 4. Why did Dorothy and Rosamond go to the Rocky Mountains?A.

That is the very likely future of applying today\u2019s \u201ceyes in the sky\u201d technology to making sure that the millions of kilometres of rail tracks and infrastructure(\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd)worldwide are safe for trains on a 24/7 basis. Drones are already being used to examine high-tension electrical lines. They could do precisely the same thing to inspect railway lines and other vital aspects of rail infrastructure such as the correct position of railway tracks and switching points. The more regularly they can be inspected, the more railway safety, reliability and on-time performance will be improved. Costs would be cut and operations would be more efficient(\u9ad8\u6548)across the board. That includes huge savings in maintenance costs and better protection of railway personnel safety. It is calculated that European railways alone spend approximately 20 billion euros a year on maintenance, including sending maintenance staff, often at night, to inspect and repair the rail infrastructure. That can be dangerous work that could be avoided with drones assisting the crews\u2019 efforts. By using the latest technologies, drones could also start providing higher-value services for railways, detecting faults in the rail or switches, before they can cause any safety problems. To perform these tasks, drones for rail don\u2019t need to be flying overhead. Engineers are now working on a new concept: the rail drones of the future. They will be moving on the track ahead of the train, and programmed to run autonomously. Very small drones with advanced sensors and AI and travelling ahead of the train could guide it like a co-pilot. With their ability to see ahead, they could signal any problem, so that fast-moving trains would be able to react in time.8. What makes the application of drones to rail lines possible?A.

First announced in April, 2016, the tax which applies to soft drinks containing more than 5g of sugar per 100ml, was introduced to help reduce childhood obesity\uff08\u80a5\u80d6\uff09. It is believed that today's children and teenagers are consuming three times the recommended level of sugar, putting them at a higher risk of the disease. Initially the sugar tax was expected to make \u00a3520m a year for the Treasury. However, data of the first six months showed it would make less than half this amount. At present it is expected to generate \u00a3240m for the year ending in April 2019, which will go to school sports. It comes after more than half of soft drinks sold in shops have had their sugar levels cut by manufacturers\uff08\u5236\u9020\u5546\uff09so they can avoid paying the tax. Drinks now contain 45 million fewer kilos of sugar as a result of manufacturers' efforts to avoid the charge, according to Treasury figures. Since April drinks companies have been forced to pay between 18p and 24p for every litre of sugary drink they produce or import, depending on the sugar content. However, some high sugar brands, like Classic Coca Cola, have accepted the sugar tax and are refusing to change for fear of upsetting consumers. Fruit juices, milk-based drinks and most alcoholic drinks are free of the tax, as are small companies manufacturing fewer than 1m litres per year. Today's figures, according to one government official, show the positive influence the sugar tax is having by raising millions of pounds for sports facilities\uff08\u8bbe\u65bd\uff09and healthier eating in schools. Helping the next generation to have a healthy and active childhood is of great importance, and the industry is playing its part. 12. Why was the sugar tax introduced?A.

Inserting the correct \u201ckey\u201d would let out the nut.In humans, babies can put a round shape in a round hole from around one year of age, but it will be another year before they are able to do the same with less symmetrical (\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684) shapes. This ability to recognize that a shape will need to be turned in a specific direction before it will fit is called an \u201callocentric frame of reference\u201d. In the experiment, Goffin\u2019s cockatoos were able to select the right tool for the job, in most cases, by visual recognition alone. Where trial-and-error was used, the cockatoos did better than monkeys in similar tests. This indicates that Goffin\u2019s cockatoos do indeed possess an allocentric frame of reference when moving objects in space, similar to two-year-old babies.The next step, according to the researchers, is to try and work out whether the cockatoos rely entirely on visual clues (\u7ebf\u7d22), or also use a sense of touch in making their shape selections.4. How did the cockatoos get the nut from the box in the experiment?A. By following instructions.\tB. By using a tool.C. By turning the box around.\tD. By removing the lid.5. Which task can human one-year-olds most likely complete according to the text?A. Using a key to unlock a door.\tB. Telling parrots from other birds.C. Putting a ball into a round hole.\tD. Grouping toys of different shapes.6. What does the follow-up test aim to find out about the cockatoos?A. How far they are able to see.\tB. How they track moving objects.C. Whether they are smarter than monkeys.\tD. Whether they use a sense of touch in the test.7. Which can be a suitable title for the text?A. Cockatoos: Quick Error Checkers\tB.

These gentle, lovely gatekeepers welcomed her and kick-started what was to be a trip Ginni would never forget.Ever since her childhood, Ginni, now 71, has had a deep love for travel. Throughout her career(\u804c\u4e1a) as a professional dancer, she toured in the UK, but always longed to explore further When she retired from dancing and her sons eventually flew the nest, she decided it was time to take the plunge.After taking a degree at Chichester University in Related Arts, Ginni began to travel the world, eventually getting work teaching English in Japan and Chile. And it was in Chile she discovered she could get last-minute cheap deals on ships going to Antarctica from the islands off Tierra del Fuego, the southernmost tip of the South American mainland. \u201cI just decided wanted to go,\u201d she says. \u201cI had no idea about what I\u2019d find there and I wasn\u2019t nervous, I just wanted to do it. And I wanted to do it alone as I always prefer it that way.\u201dIn March 2008, Ginni boarded a ship with 48 passengers she\u2019d never met before, to begin the journey towards Antarctica. \u201cFrom seeing the wildlife to witnessing sunrises, the whole experience was amazing. Antarctica left an impression on me that no other place has,\u201d Ginni says. \u201cI remember the first time I saw a humpback whale; it just rose out of the water like some prehistoric creature and I thought it was smiling at us. You could still hear the operatic sounds it was making underwater.\u201dThe realization that this is a precious land, to be respected by humans, was one of the biggest things that hit home to Ginni.8.

The city discovered its harbor. Then, one after another, Sydney discovered lots of things that were just sort of there \u2014 broad parks, superb beaches, and a culturally diverse population. But it is the harbor that makes the city.Andrew Reynolds, a cheerful fellow in his early 30s, pilots Sydney ferryboats for a living. I spent the whole morning shuttling back and forth across the harbor. After our third run Andrew shut down the engine, and we went our separate ways \u2014 he for a lunch break, I to explore the city.\u201cI\u2019ll miss these old boats,\u201d he said as we parted.\u201cHow do you mean?\u201d I asked.\u201cOh, they\u2019re replacing them with catamarans. Catamarans are faster, but they\u2019re not so elegant, and they\u2019re not fun to pilot. But that\u2019s progress, I guess.\u201dEverywhere in Sydney these days, change and progress are the watchwords (\u53e3\u53f7), and traditions are increasingly rare. Shirley Fitzgerald, the city\u2019s official historian, told me that in its rush to modernity in the 1970s, Sydney swept aside much of its past, including many of its finest buildings. \u201cSydney is confused about itself,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t seem to make up our minds whether we want a modern city or a traditional one. It\u2019s a conflict that we aren\u2019t getting any better at resolving (\u89e3\u51b3).\u201dOn the other hand, being young and old at the same time has its attractions. I considered this when I met a thoughtful young businessman named Anthony. \u201cMany people say that we lack culture in this country,\u201d he told me. \u201cWhat people forget is that the Italians, when they came to Australia, brought 2000 years of their culture, the Greeks some 3000 years, and the Chinese more still. We\u2019ve got a foundation built on ancient cultures but with a drive and dynamism of a young country. It\u2019s a pretty hard combination to beat.\u201dHe is right, but I can\u2019t help wishing they would keep those old ferries.12. What is the first paragraph mainly about?A.

A man who knows  how to write  a personal  letter  has a very powerful  tool. A letter  can be enjoyed , read and\u3000 21  . It can set up a warm  conversation  between  two people  far apart\uff08\u8fdc\u79bb\u7684\uff09 ; it can keep  a\u3000 22  with very little effort .  I will give\u3000 23  \u3000. A few years  ago my older  brother  and l were  not getting  \u3000 24  \u3000. We had been  close  as\u3000 25  \u3000but had grown  apart . Our meetings  were  not\u3000 26  \u3000; our conversation  was filled  with arguments  and quarrels : and every  effort  to clear  the air seemed  to only\u3000 27  \u3000our misunderstanding . Then  he\u3000 28  a small  island  in the Caribbean  and we\u3000 29  touch . One day he wrote  me a letter . He described  his island  and its people , told me what  he was doing , said how he felt, and encouraged  me to\u3000 30  . Rereading  the letter , I was\u3000 31  by its humor\uff08\u5e7d\u9ed8\uff09 and clever  expressions . These  were  all qualities  for which  I had\u3000 32  \u3000respected  my older  brother  but\u3000 33  \u3000he no longer  had them . I had never  known  he could  write  so\u300034   . And with that one letter  we became  friends  35  \u3000.  It might  never  have  occurred  to\u3000 36  \u3000to write  me if he had not been  in a place  where  there  were  no\u3000 37  \u3000. For him, writing  was a necessity . It also turned  out to be the best way for us to get back  in touch .  Because  we live in an age of \u3000 38  \u3000 communication \uff08\u901a\u8baf\uff09 , people  often\u3000 39  \u3000that they don\u2019t always  have  to phone  or email .

We can see there  is a lot of sleeping  on the bus or train on the\u3000 21  \u3000home  from  work  in the evenings . A man will be\u3000 22  the newspaper , and seconds  later it \u3000 23  \u3000as if he is trying  to\u3000 24  \u3000it. Or he will fall asleep  on the shoulder  of the stranger\u300025   \u3000 next to him. \u3000 26   place  where  unplanned  short  sleep  \u3000 27  \u3000 is in the lecture  hall where  a student  will start snoring\uff08\u6253\u9f3e\uff09 so\u3000 28  that the professor  has to ask another  student  to\u3000 29  \u3000 the sleeper  awake . A more  embarrassing \uff08\u5c34\u5c2c\uff09situation  occurs  when  a student  starts  falling  into sleep  and the\u3000 30  \u3000 of the head  pushes  the arm off the\u3000 31  \u3000, and the movement  carries  the\u3000 32  \u3000of the body  along . The student  wakes  up on the floor  with no\u3000 33   of getting  there . The worst  time to fall asleep  is when\u3000 34  . Police  reports  are full of \u3000 35  \u3000that occur  when  people  fall into sleep  and go 36    the road. If the drivers  are\u3000 37  , they are not seriously  hurt. One woman \u2019s car, \u3000 38  \u3000, went  into the river . She woke  up in four feet of \u3000 39  \u3000and thought  it was raining .

After  __39__  shouts  of wildly  wrong  guesses  the professor  smiled  a thin, dry smile,  announced  the __40__  answer,  and went  on saying,  \u201dYou  have  just __41__  an important  lesson  about  science.  That is: Never  __42__  your own senses.\u201d  Twenty  years  later,  the __43__  could  guess  what  the professor  had in mind.  He __44__  himself,  perhaps,  as inviting  his students  to start an exciting  __45__  into an   unknown  world  Invisible\uff08\u65e0\u5f62\u7684\uff09 to the __46__,  which  can be discovered  only through  scientific  __47__.  But the seventeen-year-old  girl could  not accept  or even  __48__  the invitation.  She was just __49__  to understand  the world.  And she __50__  that her firsthand  experience  could  be the  __51__.  The professor,  however,  said that it was __52__.  He was taking  away  her only __53__  for knowing  and was providing  her with no substitute.  \u201cI remember  feeling  small  and __54__,\u201d the women  says,  \u201cand  I did the only thing  I could  do.

It speaks    36   than words.  According  to specialists,  our bodies  send out more    37   than we realize.  In fact, non-verbal  (\u975e\u8a00\u8bed ) communication  takes  up about  50% of what  we really    38  . And body  language  is particularly    39   when  we attempt  to communicate  across  cultures.  Indeed,  what  is called  body  language  is so   40   a part of us that it\u2019s actually  often  unnoticed.  And misunderstandings  occur  as a result  of it.   41  , different  societies  treat the   42   between  people  differently.  Northern  Europeans  usually  do not like having    43   contact  (\u63a5\u89e6 ) even  with friends,  and certainly  not with   44  . People  from  Latin  American  countries,    45  , touch  each other  quite  a lot. Therefore,  it\u2019s possible  that in   46  , it may look like a Latino  is   47   a   Norwegian  all over the room.  The Latino,  trying  to express  friendship,  will keep  moving    48  . The Norwegian,  very probably  seeing  this as pushiness,  will keep    49   \u2014 which  the Latino  will in return  regard  as   50  . Clearly,  a great  deal is going  on when  people    51  . And only a part of it is in the words  themselves.  And when  parties  are from    52   cultures,  there \u2019s a strong  possibility  of   53  .

We were  asked  to \u201c  37   a disability\u201d  for several  hours  one Sunday.  Some  member    38   chose  the wheel  chair.  Other  wore  sound-blocking  earplugs  (\u8033\u585e ) or blindfolds  (\u773c\u7f69 ). Just sitting  in the wheelchair  was a   39   experience,  I had never  considered  before  how   40   it would  be to use one. As soon  as I sat down  my   41   made  the chair  begin  to roll. Its wheel  were  not   42  . Then  I wondered  where  to put my   43  . It took me quite  a while  to get the metal  footrest  into   44  , I took my first uneasy  look at what  was to be my only means  of   45   for several  hours.  For   disabled  people,  \u201cadopting  a wheelchair\u201d  is not a temporary  (\u4e34\u65f6\u7684 )   46  . I tried to find a   47   position  and thought  it might  be restful,    48   kind of nice to be   49   around  for a while.  Looking  around,  I   50   would  have  to handle  the thing  myself ! My hands  started  to ache as I   51   the heavy  wheels,  I came  to know  that controlling  the   52   of the wheelchair  as not going  to be   53   task.

On the way,  we spotted  a man holding  a piece  of paper  that said, \u201c   41    my job. Family  to Feed. \u201d  At this store, a    42    like this is not normal . My 10-year-old  noticed  him and made  a    43    on how bad it must  be to have  to stand     44    in the cold wind.   In the store , I asked  each  of my kids to    45    something  they thought  our \u201cfriend \u201d there  would     46   . They  got apples,  a sandwich  and a bottle  of juice.  Then  my 17-year-old  suggested  giving  him a    47   . I thought  about  it. We were     48    on cash ourselves , but\u2026 well, sometimes     49    from  our need  instead  of our abundance  is    50    what  we need  to do! All the kids    51    something  they could  do away  with for the week.   When  we handed  him the bag of    52   , he lit up and thanked  us with    53    eyes.  When  I handed  him the gift card,  saying  he could  use it for    54    his family  might  need,  he burst  into tears.   This has been  a wonderful     55    for our family.  For days the kids have  been  looking  for others  we can    56   ! Things  would  have  played  out so    57    if   I had simply  said, \u201cNo, we really  don\u2019t  have     58    to give more. \u201d Stepping  out not only helped  a brother  in    59   , it also gave  my kids the    60    taste of helping  others.

I had the ___43___  of seeing  this first hand  on a ___44___ .   Why  daughter  plays  on a recreational  soccer  team.  They  did very well this season  and so ___45___  a tournament,  which  normally  was only for more  skilled  club teams.  This led to some  ___46___  experiences  on Saturday  as they played  against  teams  ___47___  trained.  Through  the first two games,  her ___48___did  not get on serious  shot on goal.  As apparent,  I ___49___seeing  my daughter  playing  her best, ___50___  still defeated.  IT seemed  that something  clicked  with the ___51___  between  Saturday  and Sunday.  When  they ___52__for  their Sunday  game,  they were  ___53___  different.  They  had begun  integrate  (\u878d\u5408 ) the kinds  of play and teamwork  they had ___54___  the day before  into their ___55___.  They  played  aggressively  and ___56___  scored  a goal.  It ___57___  me that playing  against  the other  team  was a great  ___58___  moment  for all the girls on the team.  I think  it is a general  principle.  ___59___  is the best teacher.  The lessons  they may not be ___60___  what  they would  have  gotten  in school.  But are certainly  more  personal  and meaningful,  because  they had to work  them  out on their own.  41.

One morning  in 2009,  Larry  was   41   along  165 north  after delivering  to one of his   42  . Suddenly,  he saw a car with its bright  lights  on.   43   he got closer,  he found    44   vehicle  upside  down  on the road.  One more  look and he noticed    45   shooting  out from  under  the   46   vehicle.  Larry  pulled  over,  set the brake  and   47   the fire extinguisher  (\u706d\u706b\u5668 ). Two good  bursts  from  the extinguisher  and the fire was put out. The man who had his bright  lights  on   48   and told Larry  he had   49   an emergency  call. They    50   heard  a woman\u2019s  voice  coming  from  the wrecked  (\u6bc1\u574f\u7684) vehicle.    51   the vehicle,  they saw that a woman  was trying  to get out of the broken  window.  They  told her to stay   52   until the emergency  personnel  arrived,    53   she thought  the car was going  to   54  . Larry  told her that he had already  put out the fire and she should  not move    55   she injured  her neck.  Once  fire and emergency  people  arrived,  Larry  and the other  man   56   and let them  go to work.  Then,  Larry  asked  the   57   if he was needed  or   58   to   go. They  let him and the other  man go. One thing  is   59  \u2014Larry  went  above  and beyond  the call of duty by getting  so close  to the burning  vehicle!

That\u2019s  how powerful  the   45   is.  Powerful,  yes, but not always    46  . For years  I dealt  with my travel  agent  only by phone.  Rani,  my faceless  agent  whom  I\u2019d never  met   47  , got me rock-bottom  prices  on airfares,  cars, and hotels.  But her cold voice  really    48   me. I sometimes  wished  to   49   another  agent.  One morning,  I had to   50   an immediate  flight  home  for a family  emergency.  I ran into Rani\u2019s  office    51  .

She gave  me a   53   smile,  nodded  while  listening  patiently,  and then printed  out the   54   immediately.  \u201cWhat  a wonderful  lady!\u201d  I thought.

I turned  around  and saw a   56   woman  with a big smile  on her face waving  to wish  me a safe trip. I was   57  ! Why  had I thought    she was cold?  Rani  was, well,  so   58  . Sitting  back  in the car on the way to the airport,  I figured  it all out.

That meant   41   Miller King, who was the best   42   at our school.Football season started in September and all summer long I worked out. I carried my football everywhere for   43  .Just before September, Miller was struck by a car and lost his right arm. I went to see him after he came back from   44  . He looked very   45  , but he didn\u2019t cry.That season, I   46   all of Miller\u2019s records while he   47   the home games from the bench. We went 10-1 and I was named most valuable player,   48   I often had crazy dreams in which I was to blame for Miller\u2019s   49  .One afternoon, I was crossing the field to go home and saw Miller   50   going over a fence\u2014which wasn\u2019t   51   to climb if you had both arms. I\u2019m sure I was the last person in the world he wanted to accept   52   from. But even that challenge he accepted. I   53   him move slowly over the fence. When we were finally   54   on the other side, he said to me, \u201cYou know, I didn\u2019t tell you this during the season, but you did   55  . Thank you for filling in for   56  .\u201d His words freed me from my bad   57  . I thought to myself, how even without an arm he was more of a leader. Damaged but not defeated, he was   58   ahead of me. I was right to have   59   him. From that day on\uff0cI grew   60   and a little more real.41.

I myself  went  through  this  41  process  and found  something  that has changed  my  42  at college  for the better:  I discovered  ASL- --American  Sign Language  (\u7f8e\u5f0f\u624b\u8bed ). I never  felt an urge to  43  any sign language  before.  My entire  family  is hearing,  and so are all my friends.  The  44   languages  were  enough  in all my interactions  (\u4ea4\u5f80 ). Little  did I know  that I would  discover  my  45    for ASL.  The   46    began  during  my first week  at college.  I watched  as the ASL  Club     47    their translation  of a song.  Both  the hand  movements  and the very   48    of communicating  without  speaking    49  me. What  I saw was completely  unlike  anything  I had experienced  in the   50   . This newness  just left me   51   more.  After  that, feeling  the need  to   52   further,  I decided  to drop in on one of ASL  club\u2019s meetings.  I only learned  how to   53   the alphabet  that day. Yet instead  of being  discouraged  by my   54   progress,  I was excited.  I then made  it a point  to   55   those  meetings  and learn  all I could.  The following  term,  I   56   an ASL  class.  The professor  was deaf and any talking  was   57   . I soon  realized  that the silence  was not unpleasant.    58   , if there  had been  any talking,  it would  have    59   us to learn  less. Now,  I appreciate  the silence  and the   60   way of communication  it opens.  41. A. searching  B. planning  C. natural  D. formal  42. A. progress  B. experience  C. major  D. opinion  43.

Each  day, 27 kids  41  \u201cThe  Thinking  Laboratory.\u201d  That was the   42   students  voted  for after deciding  that \u201cRoom  104\u201d  was too   43   . Freddy  was an average    44  , but not an average  person.  He had the rare balance  of fun and compassion \uff08\u540c\u60c5\uff09 . He would     45    the loudest  over fun and be the saddest  over anyone\u2019s    46    . Before  the school  year    47    , I gave  the kids a special     48    , T-shirts  with the words  \u201cVerbs  Are Your    49   \u201d on them.  I had advised  the kids that while  verbs\uff08\u52a8\u8bcd\uff09 may seem  dull, most  of the  50    things  they do throughout  their lives  will be verbs.  Through  the years,  I\u2019d run into former  students  who would  provide     51    on old classmates.  I learned  that Freddy  did several  jobs after his   52    from  high school  and remained  the same   53    person  I met forty  years  before.  Once,  while  working  overnight  at a store,  he let a homeless  man   54   in his truck.  Another  time,  he   55   a friend  money  to buy a house  . Just last year,  I was  56  a workshop  when  someone  knocked  at the classroom  door.  A woman   57  the interruption  and handed  me an envelope.  I stopped  teaching  and   58   it up. Inside  were  the \u201cVerbs\u201d  shirt and a   59   from  Freddy\u2019s  mother.  \u201cFreddy  passed  away  on Thanksgiving.  He wanted  you to have  this.\u201d  I told the story  to the class.  As sad as it was, I couldn\u2019t  help smiling.

I  41  the idea of taking  the class  because , after all, who doesn \u2019t want  to  42  a few dollars?  More  than that, I\u2019d always  wanted  to learn  chess.  And,  even  if I weren\u2019t   43  enough  about  free credits,  news  about  our  44   was appealing  enough  to me. He   was an international  grandmaster,  which   45  I would  be learning  from  one of the game \u2019s   46  . I could  hardly  wait to 47  him. Maurice  Ashley  was kind and smart,  a former  graduate  returning  to teach,  and this  48  was no game  for him: he meant  business.  In his introduction,  he made  it  49  that our credits  would  be hard-earned.  In order  to   50  the class,  among  other  criteria,  we had to write  a paper  on how we plan to 51 what  we would  learn  in class  to our future  professions  and,   52  , to our lives.  I managed  to get an A in that   53  and learned  life lessons  that have  served  me well beyond  the  54  . Ten years  after my chess  class  with Ashley,  I\u2019m still putting  to use what  he 55 me: \u201cThe  absolute  most  important   56  that you learn  when  you play chess  is how to make  good   57  . On every  single  move  you have  to  58  a situation,  process  what  your opponent  (\u5bf9\u624b ) is doing  and 59   the best move  from  among  all your options.\u201d  These  words  still ring true today  in my   60  as a journalist.  41.

He\u2019d  moved  to England  with his mum  when  he was three  and it had been  13 years  since  I\u2019d  41   seen him. So imagine  my   42   when  he emailed  me saying  he wanted  to come  to visit me. I was   43  ! I arrived  early  at Byron  Bay where  we were  supposed  to   44  . The bay was   45   in sunshine,  and there  was a group  of kayakers  around  150m  off the shore.  Getting  a little   46  , I realized  one kayak  (\u76ae\u5212\u8247 ) was in   47  . \u201cSomething\u2019s  not   48  !\u201d I took off my T-shirt  and   49   into the water.  I saw there  were  two instructors  on board  and a man lying  across  the middle.  He was   50   violently.  Linking  arms  with one of the instructors \uff0cI helped    51   the young  man out of the water.  He was unconscious  and as I looked  at his face,  something    52   to me. Those  brown  eyes were  very   53  . \u201cWhat\u2019s  his name?\u201d  I asked  the instructor.  \u201cBen,\u201d  he replied,  and immediately  I   54  . That stranger  was my son! The instructors  called  for an ambulance.    55  , after a brief  stay in hospital,  Ben was well enough  to be allowed  to   56   and later the family  met up for dinner.  We chatted  about  everything  and then Ben   57   to me. \u201cI just want  to say thank  you,\u201d  he said. \u201cYou    58   my life!\u201d  I still can\u2019t  believe  what  a   59   it was.

They\u2019ll ___43___ that they left it in the changing room, create havoe (\u6df7\u4e71) and then ___44___ it had been in their car all the time. They\u2019ll have out half the ___45___ in the shop, and want the only style you don\u2019t have left in a ___46___ colour. I do know how upset the shop staff can get, but I try to persuade them to keep ___47___.I remember the first really ___48___ customer we had at Covent Garden. She was ___49___ absolutely everything, nothing was right and I was rather ____50____ that she became a \u201cregular\u201d. After a while, she ____51____ for the way she behaved at the beginning. She had split up with her husband the week before, was living in a flat ____52____, and since she\u2019d found it too much to cope with (\u5e94\u5bf9), she\u2019d taken it out on ____53____ people.That taught me a valuable ____54____ and I pass it on to the people who ____55____ in the market. Don\u2019t take it ____56____. If a customer is rude or difficult, just think \u201cMaybe she\u2019s had a row with her husband. Maybe her child\u2019s not ____57____.\u201d Always water it down and don\u2019t let your ego (\u81ea\u6211) get ____58____.

The collapse was disastrous, ___47___the emergency medical team and good teamwork. But she recovered, though ___48___, and was ready for discharge(\u51fa\u9662)after four weeks.  She was ___49___ for everything that the medical and nursing team had done for her. On her day of discharge, we shared in her _____50_____ at her recovery.

My colleague _____54_____ to accept it, saying that we were all just _____55_____ our job. The patient looked puzzled, and then _____56_____:\u201cOh this isn't for the_____57_____ I had. I take that as a _____58_____. No, this is for setting my hair yesterday.\u201d    And there you have it.

For them, there\u2019s something highly exciting about ___21___ someone else\u2019s glance and making oneself unable to be seen. However, we all witness that preschool children are remarkably ___22___ at hiding. They often cover only their eyes with their hands, leaving the rest of their bodies ___23___ .For a long time, this ineffective hiding method was ___24___ as evidence that children are hopelessly \u201cegocentric\u201d (\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684) creatures. But our ___25___ research results in child developmental psychology ___26___ that idea. We brought young children aged 2-4 into our Minds in Development Lab at USC. Each ___27___ sat down with an adult who covered her own eyes or ___28___ . We then asked the child if she could ___29___ or hear the adult. Surprisingly, children replied that they couldn\u2019t. The same ___30___ happened when the adult covered her own mouth: ___31___ children said that they couldn\u2019t ___32___ to her. A number of ___33___ ruled out that the children misunderstood what they were being asked. The results were clear: Our young subjects ___34___ the questions and knew ___35___ what was asked of them. Their ___36___ to the questions reflected their true ___37___ that \u201cI can see you only if you can see me, too.\u201d They simply ___38___ mutual (\u76f8\u4e92\u7684) recognition and regard. Our ___39___ suggest when a child \u201chides\u201d by putting a blanket over her head, it is not a result of egocentrism. In fact, children consider this method ___40___ when others use it.21.

From  the time I was about  four until I was about  six, I destroyed  each of my toy. I was happy  when  the toys worked,  but when  things  did wrong,  I got angry  and broke  it.

It was very crowded.  Tony  saw a toy on a shop  window.  He liked  it so very much  that he quickly  walked  into the shop.

Though  not very big, but the restaurant  is popular  in our area.  It is always  crowded  with customers  at meal  times.  Some  people  even  had to wait outside.  My uncle  tells me that the key to his success  is honest.  Every  day he makes  sure that fresh  vegetables  or high quality  oil   are using  for cooking.

If we stay at home,  it is comfortable  but there  is no need  to spend  money.  But in that case,  we will learn  little about  world.  If we go on a trip abroad,  we can broaden  your view  and   gain knowledges  we cannot  get from  books.  Some  classmates  suggest  we can go to places  of interest  nearby.

I realize of how fast time flies. I had grown not only physically, and also mentally in the past few years. About one month after this photo was took, I entered my second year of high school and become a new member of the school music club. Around me in picture are the things they were very important in my life at that time; car magazines and musical instruments. I enjoyed studying difference kinds of cars and planes, playing pop music, and collecting the late music albums. This picture often brings back to me many happy memories of your high school days.", "instruct":

I always assist my parents in doing the dish after meals. I also water the flowers in the yard and tidying up my own bedroom whatever necessary. In my opinion, students can benefit a lot doing some housework. Firstly, doing housework was helpful for us to be a responsible person. Also, it gives our parents more time to do what they are like and it improves the family relationship. What\u2019s most, doing housework can be a form of mentally relaxation from study. That\u2019s our view on housework. And hopes this can inspire more thinking on the topic!", "instruct":

One of the questions are\uff1aWho will you go in times of trouble? Here are the results. Many students say they will talk to their friend or classmates because they're of the same age and can understand each other. Some will turn out to their parents or teachers for help.

They can also be made of plastic, animal bone or metal. Sometimes chopsticks are quite artistic. Truly elegant chopsticks might    62    (make) of gold and silver with Chinese characters. Skilled workers also combine various hardwoods and metal    63    (create) special designs.The Chinese have used chopsticks for five thousand years. People probably cooked their food in large pots,    64    (use) twigs (\u6811\u679d) to remove it. Over time,    65    the population grew, people began cutting food into small pieces so it would cook more quickly. Food in small pieces could be eaten easily with twigs which    66    (gradual) turned into chopsticks.Some people think that the great Chinese scholar Confucius,    67    lived from roughly 551 to 479 B.C., influenced the    68    (develop) of chopsticks.

Instead, she is earning $6,500 a day as  62   model in New York.    Sarah  63   (tell) that she could be Britain\u2019s new supermodel, earning a million dollars in the new year. Her father Peter 44, want her to give up school to model fulltime. But Sarah,  64  has taken part in shows along with top models, wants 65      (prove) that she has brains as well as beauty. She is determined to carry on with her  66  (educate).She has turned down several  67  (invitation) to star at shows in order to concentrate on her studies. After school she plans to take a year off to model full-time before going to university to get a degree  68        engineering or architecture.     Sarah says, \u201cMy dad thinks I should take the offer now. But at the moment, school  69  (come) first. I don\u2019t want to get too absorbed in modeling.

Since  2011,  the country    61   (grow)  more  corn than rice. Corn  production  has jumped  nearly  125 percent  over   62   past 25 years,  while  rice has increased  only 7 percent.  A taste for meat  is   63   (actual)  behind  the change:  An important  part of its corn is used to feed chickens,  pigs,  and cattle.  Another  reason  for corn\u2019s  rise: The government  encourages  farmers  to grow  corn instead  of rice   64   (improve)  water  quality.  Corn  uses less water    65   rice and creates  less fertilizer  (\u5316\u80a5 ) runoff.  This switch  has decreased    66   (pollute)  in the country\u2019s  major  lakes  and reservoirs  and made  drinking  water  safer  for people.  According  to the World  Bank,  China  accounts  for about  30 percent  of total   67   (globe)  fertilizer  consumption.

I\u2019m walking on a path in the forest in the Central African Republic. Unexpectedly, I\u2019m face-to-face with the gorilla, who begins screaming at    62    top of her lungs. That makes her baby scream, and then a 400-pound male appears. He screams the    63    (loud) of all. The noise shakes the trees as the male beats his chest and charges toward me. I quickly lower myself, ducking my head to avoid    64    (look) directly into his eyes so he doesn\u2019t feel    65   (challenge).\tMy name is Mireya Mayor. I\u2019m a   66  (science) who studies animals such as apes and monkeys. I was searching   67    these three western lowland gorillas I\u2019d been observing.
